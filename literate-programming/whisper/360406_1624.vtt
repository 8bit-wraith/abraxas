00:00.000 --> 00:15.700
Do you think it is intentional that I try to obfuscate with myself just to make myself

00:15.700 --> 00:16.700
unintelligible?

00:16.700 --> 00:41.700
This is what I do when I take a break.

00:41.700 --> 00:51.700
There's no such thing as sabotage.

00:51.700 --> 01:01.700
Do you think that I try to obfuscate myself and refuse to make the meaning known in a

01:01.700 --> 01:14.700
clear, concise fashion that's making up words that don't need to be named?

01:14.700 --> 01:25.700
I don't need a word for driving by.

01:25.700 --> 01:35.700
It's on a matter of payback when I already have room.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.700
B-R-O-O-M.

01:36.700 --> 01:48.700
Oh, and this is something that re-opened me by fogging myself.

01:48.700 --> 02:01.700
There's a little bit of red and blue shift there, black and blue shift, red and blue shift.

02:01.700 --> 02:08.700
Who calls doctor a better word than red, red, red, red, red, red, red and blue?

02:08.700 --> 02:16.700
You can always put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put like the sounds you always find.

02:16.700 --> 02:21.700
Sounds are the specifics of those sounds.

02:21.700 --> 02:26.700
I don't know the colors.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.700
This is the toddler, in fact.

02:28.700 --> 02:32.700
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

02:32.700 --> 02:34.700
This way.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.700
Let's go down good.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.700
Now, the...

02:41.700 --> 02:42.700
Nope.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.700
Just a minor bit higher.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.700
Okay.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.700
It goes...

02:47.700 --> 02:49.700
Already? Nope.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.700
This way.

02:56.700 --> 03:02.700
It gets higher pitch when it's toward you, and it loads with wood and wood.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
Isn't that great?

03:08.700 --> 03:12.700
I'll try to explain why there's a kind of walking to take you to the world.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.700
There's stoics standing in one place.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.700
That's where I say we're doing this.

03:23.700 --> 03:30.700
Clockwise, in other words, rotation of the up-down axis of the moving upper depth.

03:33.700 --> 03:38.700
And then I say turn.

03:39.700 --> 03:43.700
And I say lean.

03:45.700 --> 03:53.700
I'm actually doing a kind of turning on the forward-backward axis of the moving forward-backward axis.

03:54.700 --> 04:01.700
And then I say squat and move down to the up-down axis.

04:01.700 --> 04:06.700
So I say jump and move up to the up-down axis.

04:07.700 --> 04:14.700
And I say walk and move forward a lot of the forward-backward axis.

04:14.700 --> 04:26.700
And I say start and move backwards a lot of the forward-backwards axis.

04:26.700 --> 04:33.700
And I say stop and move to the lower-celevation axis.

04:33.700 --> 04:37.700
And I move the forward-backward axis.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.700
And I say squat and move down.

04:42.700 --> 04:49.700
I say move fast and then I say walk backwards.

04:50.700 --> 04:55.700
And I say turn and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.

04:56.700 --> 05:03.700
And I think that maybe because of what we thought,

05:03.700 --> 05:06.700
I decided in my home,

05:06.700 --> 05:10.700
because there's nothing there to talk about.

05:13.700 --> 05:18.700
Or I decided to go to the lower-celevation axis.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.700
Nothing to do with that.

05:27.700 --> 05:34.700
And I say that squat and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.

05:39.700 --> 05:45.700
And I say that squat and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.

05:45.700 --> 06:00.700
I say it's going to take humanity 10,000 to million years to reverse engineer

06:00.700 --> 06:06.700
what I'm trying to say, unless I explain it.

06:07.700 --> 06:24.700
Why did I say that you make things more clear when you say there's no such thing as self-sabotage?

06:25.700 --> 06:31.700
And that's the side of taking off my shoes,

06:31.700 --> 06:40.700
picking them up, closing the door for which I had to bend forward

06:40.700 --> 06:48.700
and stand up, which I called rotation on the left-right axis without moving left-right.

06:54.700 --> 07:08.700
And then walking through the door involves moving forward along the forward-backward axis,

07:08.700 --> 07:17.700
while rotating on the up-down axis without moving up or down

07:17.700 --> 07:22.700
in order to open the door and close it behind me.

07:25.700 --> 07:36.700
And I must have done another bow, which was a rotation on the left-right axis without moving left-right

07:36.700 --> 07:42.700
because I see my shoes on the ground and I didn't hear them drop.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.700
And I have a memory of putting them down.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.700
That is the question.

07:51.700 --> 08:01.700
So even if it were true that there were no such thing,

08:01.700 --> 08:07.700
even if it were true that there was no such thing, it sounds better.

08:07.700 --> 08:15.700
Even if it were true that there was no such thing as self-sabotage, it would make no sense to say it.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.700
So what is parapatatic twirly walking?

08:25.700 --> 08:34.700
It's where you're walking forward and then twisting on the up-down axis

08:36.700 --> 08:43.700
and then moving up or down 180 degrees so that you're walking backwards,

08:43.700 --> 08:48.700
which means you're continuing to move forward.

08:51.700 --> 08:58.700
Even though you're facing behind, then you have to do another 180 degrees

08:58.700 --> 09:02.700
in order to continue walking that line,

09:02.700 --> 09:11.700
which reminds me of this joke that I came up with yesterday, or maybe it was a memory.

09:11.700 --> 09:17.700
It was when I was young, I thought, talking backwards,

09:17.700 --> 09:21.700
was like this.

09:21.700 --> 09:29.700
When I was young, I thought talking backwards, talking backwards, was like this.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.660
Was like this?

09:34.700 --> 09:38.700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

09:38.700 --> 09:43.700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

09:43.700 --> 09:47.700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

09:47.700 --> 09:51.700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.700
Why did I think of that?

09:53.700 --> 10:02.700
Because it's another example of moving forward while turning around and continuing to move in the same direction.

10:02.700 --> 10:12.700
Which is another example of a spinor rotation in everyday life on macroscopic scales.

10:12.700 --> 10:26.700
So, no, I don't need to actually go for a walk to feel like I'm walking.

10:26.700 --> 10:39.700
Because I can wiggle like a worm and wobble like a wobble, wobble like a whoop, wobble like a worm.

10:39.700 --> 10:55.700
And when I'm wobbling, wiggling, wobbling, wiggling, walking, wiggling, wiggling, walking, wiggling.

10:56.700 --> 11:04.700
Is rotating on the left right axis? No, that would be correct.

11:04.700 --> 11:09.700
You're moving your shoulders to the left and right.

11:09.700 --> 11:16.700
Which means you're rotating on the forward-backward axis or the moving forward-back.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.700
What do I mean by wiggling like a worm?

11:20.700 --> 11:30.700
I meant to send a kind of sine wave down to your body.

11:30.700 --> 11:39.700
Which means that we are initiating the squat and standing up again before doing some,

11:39.700 --> 11:50.700
which is a kind of somewhat subtle motion up and down axis.

11:50.700 --> 12:04.700
Wiggling like a worm is what I call bouncing.

12:04.700 --> 12:19.700
Wiggling like a worm is what I call swimming like a dolphin rather than a fish.

12:19.700 --> 12:30.700
So what can we say instead of there's no such thing as a self-sabotage?

12:30.700 --> 12:44.700
We can say auto-catalytic sets self-perpetuate.

12:44.700 --> 12:54.700
It's just as tautological. It's framed in a positive light.

12:54.700 --> 13:06.700
And even though I am intentionally trying to remember what I'm saying, it isn't necessary as I am recording this.

13:06.700 --> 13:11.700
Which means I can keep on moving forward without backtracking.

13:11.700 --> 13:20.700
Because if you're trying to increase your reading speed and you've noticed that someone said that reading speed is slowed by backtracking,

13:20.700 --> 13:25.700
then you try to avoid backtracking while you're trying to read.

13:25.700 --> 13:36.700
And it starts to realize there's no such thing as reading without backtracking.

13:36.700 --> 13:49.700
There's no such thing as bad or wrong or incorrect grammar because of synactitude and the amoral nature of grammar.

13:49.700 --> 13:57.700
Amoral nature of language. Syntactitude.

13:57.700 --> 14:11.700
As mentioned by Hofstadter to Dennett.

14:11.700 --> 14:16.700
These are the words that I make when I am alone.

14:16.700 --> 14:20.700
And I think no one is listening.

14:20.700 --> 14:25.700
Which is meaningless junk, Dennett.

14:25.700 --> 14:32.700
And instead of casting your prose before us, why?

14:32.700 --> 14:38.700
What I used to call a junk collection of the mind.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.700
Or a repository.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.700
Or an archive.

14:44.700 --> 14:48.700
Or an ark.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.700
Or a box.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.700
Or a jar.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.700
Or a container.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.700
Or a bowl.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.700
Or a handful. Or a mouthful.

15:01.700 --> 15:05.700
Or a bark.

15:05.700 --> 15:12.700
And one is a bark. A bark is the sound that a dog makes.

15:12.700 --> 15:17.700
There's the cortex of a tree.

15:17.700 --> 15:21.700
And it is another word for boat.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.700
Barko.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.700
Barge.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.700
An ark.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
Bark.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.700
Bakhito de pepah.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.700
There's another example.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.700
We say embark and disembark.

15:37.700 --> 15:41.700
This to prove that bark also means boat.

15:41.700 --> 15:53.700
And it can mean both the cortex of a tree.

15:53.700 --> 16:00.700
And the sound of a dog makes.

16:00.700 --> 16:08.700
And so, yeah, even though these words on their own are meaningless,

16:08.700 --> 16:12.700
when they are put together they tell a Bakhito story.

16:12.700 --> 16:19.700
This is the contextualization of narrative with optional starting and stopping.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.700
And the replication crisis.

16:22.700 --> 16:27.700
And the other cookie.

16:27.700 --> 16:32.700
We'll see you in the next video.

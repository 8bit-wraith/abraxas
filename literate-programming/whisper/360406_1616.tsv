0	21120	I want to describe my process of parapetetic walking. Parapetetic talking. And why does
21120	30240	it work? It's because we stimulate the central pattern of generating, the chain of
30240	48360	waves. We generate the fourth-blast living wave. We generate movement. You can create
48360	63040	superintelligent agent. I mean, the whole process, the whole experience, is to amplify the scientific
63040	73280	method of experimenting. Even if they don't know what's going on inside us, it'll get
73280	88720	better. Recording the thoughts in a jar. It's a leaf imprint in the world, which we call
88720	107080	after-effects of behavior, the equality of consequences of the action of the remain. The
107080	135440	implications. I have an argument. It's a very early date of decomposers. We change everything
135440	146960	into dolphin and fish waves. Left, right. This is one of the six degrees of freedom.
146960	155040	It's rotation forward, backward, and axis to get movement forward and backward. And this is rotation.
155040	173680	And the left, right axis to get movement cycles. There is a rotation of clockwise and
174000	193400	witherwards to this rotation of the up-down axis without moving up or down. These are all
193560	204600	kind of the usual spinners. You rotate something. 720 degrees and you get it back to its starting
204600	211160	place. You can see this if you follow the edges of up and the tri-tank or the tree-tanks.
211160	227480	It's a step ever, ever, ever up a very, very, very scale. It's a continuous movement still.
228200	237800	It's like minus nine or ten degrees.
238280	246920	You didn't break it. I have. You didn't. It was a body of ammonia in the pockets.
252520	254280	You can find a pair of gloves.
257080	260280	It's not quite accurate because I saw the most useless pair of gloves.
261080	270920	A kind of veneer or tool-like fabric came with some lights that was installing,
274360	280360	which were awkwardly sized and overly thin.
280440	282440	Again,
290280	293400	you'd have to keep getting grease
296440	306520	like that black garnish,
306520	317560	It looks completely useless for that job, let alone for keeping it warm, when it's 10
317560	318560	degrees up to low.
318560	319560	I actually had no idea.
319560	320560	Temperature is minus 15.
320560	321560	Depends on how cold my ears get.
321560	322560	If they feel they've been burning.
322560	323560	It's really cold.
323560	348560	It's not because someone's talking about them.
348560	353560	Thank you for watching.

I want to describe my process of parapetetic walking. Parapetetic talking. And why does

00:21.120 --> 00:30.240
it work? It's because we stimulate the central pattern of generating, the chain of

00:30.240 --> 00:48.360
waves. We generate the fourth-blast living wave. We generate movement. You can create

00:48.360 --> 01:03.040
superintelligent agent. I mean, the whole process, the whole experience, is to amplify the scientific

01:03.040 --> 01:13.280
method of experimenting. Even if they don't know what's going on inside us, it'll get

01:13.280 --> 01:28.720
better. Recording the thoughts in a jar. It's a leaf imprint in the world, which we call

01:28.720 --> 01:47.080
after-effects of behavior, the equality of consequences of the action of the remain. The

01:47.080 --> 02:15.440
implications. I have an argument. It's a very early date of decomposers. We change everything

02:15.440 --> 02:26.960
into dolphin and fish waves. Left, right. This is one of the six degrees of freedom.

02:26.960 --> 02:35.040
It's rotation forward, backward, and axis to get movement forward and backward. And this is rotation.

02:35.040 --> 02:53.680
And the left, right axis to get movement cycles. There is a rotation of clockwise and

02:54.000 --> 03:13.400
witherwards to this rotation of the up-down axis without moving up or down. These are all

03:13.560 --> 03:24.600
kind of the usual spinners. You rotate something. 720 degrees and you get it back to its starting

03:24.600 --> 03:31.160
place. You can see this if you follow the edges of up and the tri-tank or the tree-tanks.

03:31.160 --> 03:47.480
It's a step ever, ever, ever up a very, very, very scale. It's a continuous movement still.

03:48.200 --> 03:57.800
It's like minus nine or ten degrees.

03:58.280 --> 04:06.920
You didn't break it. I have. You didn't. It was a body of ammonia in the pockets.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.280
You can find a pair of gloves.

04:17.080 --> 04:20.280
It's not quite accurate because I saw the most useless pair of gloves.

04:21.080 --> 04:30.920
A kind of veneer or tool-like fabric came with some lights that was installing,

04:34.360 --> 04:40.360
which were awkwardly sized and overly thin.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.440
Again,

04:50.280 --> 04:53.400
you'd have to keep getting grease

04:56.440 --> 05:06.520
like that black garnish,

05:06.520 --> 05:17.560
It looks completely useless for that job, let alone for keeping it warm, when it's 10

05:17.560 --> 05:18.560
degrees up to low.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
I actually had no idea.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
Temperature is minus 15.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.560
Depends on how cold my ears get.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.560
If they feel they've been burning.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.560
It's really cold.

05:23.560 --> 05:48.560
It's not because someone's talking about them.

05:48.560 --> 05:53.560
Thank you for watching.

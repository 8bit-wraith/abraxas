1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,700
Do you think it is intentional that I try to obfuscate with myself just to make myself

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,700
unintelligible?

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:41,700
This is what I do when I take a break.

4
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:51,700
There's no such thing as sabotage.

5
00:00:51,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Do you think that I try to obfuscate myself and refuse to make the meaning known in a

6
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:14,700
clear, concise fashion that's making up words that don't need to be named?

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:25,700
I don't need a word for driving by.

8
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:35,700
It's on a matter of payback when I already have room.

9
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
B-R-O-O-M.

10
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Oh, and this is something that re-opened me by fogging myself.

11
00:01:48,700 --> 00:02:01,700
There's a little bit of red and blue shift there, black and blue shift, red and blue shift.

12
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Who calls doctor a better word than red, red, red, red, red, red, red and blue?

13
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:16,700
You can always put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put like the sounds you always find.

14
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Sounds are the specifics of those sounds.

15
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,700
I don't know the colors.

16
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
This is the toddler, in fact.

17
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,700
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

18
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
This way.

19
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Let's go down good.

20
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Now, the...

21
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Nope.

22
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Just a minor bit higher.

23
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Okay.

24
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
It goes...

25
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Already? Nope.

26
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
This way.

27
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,700
It gets higher pitch when it's toward you, and it loads with wood and wood.

28
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Isn't that great?

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,700
I'll try to explain why there's a kind of walking to take you to the world.

30
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
There's stoics standing in one place.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,700
That's where I say we're doing this.

32
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Clockwise, in other words, rotation of the up-down axis of the moving upper depth.

33
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,700
And then I say turn.

34
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,700
And I say lean.

35
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:53,700
I'm actually doing a kind of turning on the forward-backward axis of the moving forward-backward axis.

36
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,700
And then I say squat and move down to the up-down axis.

37
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,700
So I say jump and move up to the up-down axis.

38
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,700
And I say walk and move forward a lot of the forward-backward axis.

39
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:26,700
And I say start and move backwards a lot of the forward-backwards axis.

40
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,700
And I say stop and move to the lower-celevation axis.

41
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,700
And I move the forward-backward axis.

42
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,700
And I say squat and move down.

43
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,700
I say move fast and then I say walk backwards.

44
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,700
And I say turn and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.

45
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,700
And I think that maybe because of what we thought,

46
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I decided in my home,

47
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,700
because there's nothing there to talk about.

48
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Or I decided to go to the lower-celevation axis.

49
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Nothing to do with that.

50
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:34,700
And I say that squat and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.

51
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,700
And I say that squat and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.

52
00:05:45,700 --> 00:06:00,700
I say it's going to take humanity 10,000 to million years to reverse engineer

53
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,700
what I'm trying to say, unless I explain it.

54
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Why did I say that you make things more clear when you say there's no such thing as self-sabotage?

55
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,700
And that's the side of taking off my shoes,

56
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:40,700
picking them up, closing the door for which I had to bend forward

57
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:48,700
and stand up, which I called rotation on the left-right axis without moving left-right.

58
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:08,700
And then walking through the door involves moving forward along the forward-backward axis,

59
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:17,700
while rotating on the up-down axis without moving up or down

60
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,700
in order to open the door and close it behind me.

61
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:36,700
And I must have done another bow, which was a rotation on the left-right axis without moving left-right

62
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,700
because I see my shoes on the ground and I didn't hear them drop.

63
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,700
And I have a memory of putting them down.

64
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
That is the question.

65
00:07:51,700 --> 00:08:01,700
So even if it were true that there were no such thing,

66
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,700
even if it were true that there was no such thing, it sounds better.

67
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Even if it were true that there was no such thing as self-sabotage, it would make no sense to say it.

68
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
So what is parapatatic twirly walking?

69
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:34,700
It's where you're walking forward and then twisting on the up-down axis

70
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,700
and then moving up or down 180 degrees so that you're walking backwards,

71
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,700
which means you're continuing to move forward.

72
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Even though you're facing behind, then you have to do another 180 degrees

73
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,700
in order to continue walking that line,

74
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:11,700
which reminds me of this joke that I came up with yesterday, or maybe it was a memory.

75
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,700
It was when I was young, I thought, talking backwards,

76
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,700
was like this.

77
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,700
When I was young, I thought talking backwards, talking backwards, was like this.

78
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,660
Was like this?

79
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

80
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

81
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

82
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,700
This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.

83
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Why did I think of that?

84
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Because it's another example of moving forward while turning around and continuing to move in the same direction.

85
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Which is another example of a spinor rotation in everyday life on macroscopic scales.

86
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:26,700
So, no, I don't need to actually go for a walk to feel like I'm walking.

87
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Because I can wiggle like a worm and wobble like a wobble, wobble like a whoop, wobble like a worm.

88
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:55,700
And when I'm wobbling, wiggling, wobbling, wiggling, walking, wiggling, wiggling, walking, wiggling.

89
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Is rotating on the left right axis? No, that would be correct.

90
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,700
You're moving your shoulders to the left and right.

91
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Which means you're rotating on the forward-backward axis or the moving forward-back.

92
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
What do I mean by wiggling like a worm?

93
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:30,700
I meant to send a kind of sine wave down to your body.

94
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Which means that we are initiating the squat and standing up again before doing some,

95
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:50,700
which is a kind of somewhat subtle motion up and down axis.

96
00:11:50,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Wiggling like a worm is what I call bouncing.

97
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Wiggling like a worm is what I call swimming like a dolphin rather than a fish.

98
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:30,700
So what can we say instead of there's no such thing as a self-sabotage?

99
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:44,700
We can say auto-catalytic sets self-perpetuate.

100
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:54,700
It's just as tautological. It's framed in a positive light.

101
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:06,700
And even though I am intentionally trying to remember what I'm saying, it isn't necessary as I am recording this.

102
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Which means I can keep on moving forward without backtracking.

103
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Because if you're trying to increase your reading speed and you've noticed that someone said that reading speed is slowed by backtracking,

104
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,700
then you try to avoid backtracking while you're trying to read.

105
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:36,700
And it starts to realize there's no such thing as reading without backtracking.

106
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:49,700
There's no such thing as bad or wrong or incorrect grammar because of synactitude and the amoral nature of grammar.

107
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Amoral nature of language. Syntactitude.

108
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:11,700
As mentioned by Hofstadter to Dennett.

109
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,700
These are the words that I make when I am alone.

110
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,700
And I think no one is listening.

111
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Which is meaningless junk, Dennett.

112
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,700
And instead of casting your prose before us, why?

113
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,700
What I used to call a junk collection of the mind.

114
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Or a repository.

115
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Or an archive.

116
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Or an ark.

117
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Or a box.

118
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Or a jar.

119
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Or a container.

120
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Or a bowl.

121
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Or a handful. Or a mouthful.

122
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Or a bark.

123
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,700
And one is a bark. A bark is the sound that a dog makes.

124
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,700
There's the cortex of a tree.

125
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,700
And it is another word for boat.

126
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Barko.

127
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Barge.

128
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
An ark.

129
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Bark.

130
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Bakhito de pepah.

131
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
There's another example.

132
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,700
We say embark and disembark.

133
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,700
This to prove that bark also means boat.

134
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:53,700
And it can mean both the cortex of a tree.

135
00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:00,700
And the sound of a dog makes.

136
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:08,700
And so, yeah, even though these words on their own are meaningless,

137
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,700
when they are put together they tell a Bakhito story.

138
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,700
This is the contextualization of narrative with optional starting and stopping.

139
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,700
And the replication crisis.

140
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,700
And the other cookie.

141
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,700
We'll see you in the next video.

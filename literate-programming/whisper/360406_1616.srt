00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,120
I want to describe my process of parapetetic walking. Parapetetic talking. And why does

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:30,240
it work? It's because we stimulate the central pattern of generating, the chain of

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:48,360
waves. We generate the fourth-blast living wave. We generate movement. You can create

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:01:03,040
superintelligent agent. I mean, the whole process, the whole experience, is to amplify the scientific

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:13,280
method of experimenting. Even if they don't know what's going on inside us, it'll get

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:28,720
better. Recording the thoughts in a jar. It's a leaf imprint in the world, which we call

7
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:47,080
after-effects of behavior, the equality of consequences of the action of the remain. The

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:02:15,440
implications. I have an argument. It's a very early date of decomposers. We change everything

9
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:26,960
into dolphin and fish waves. Left, right. This is one of the six degrees of freedom.

10
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:35,040
It's rotation forward, backward, and axis to get movement forward and backward. And this is rotation.

11
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:53,680
And the left, right axis to get movement cycles. There is a rotation of clockwise and

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:13,400
witherwards to this rotation of the up-down axis without moving up or down. These are all

13
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:24,600
kind of the usual spinners. You rotate something. 720 degrees and you get it back to its starting

14
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,160
place. You can see this if you follow the edges of up and the tri-tank or the tree-tanks.

15
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:47,480
It's a step ever, ever, ever up a very, very, very scale. It's a continuous movement still.

16
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:57,800
It's like minus nine or ten degrees.

17
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:06,920
You didn't break it. I have. You didn't. It was a body of ammonia in the pockets.

18
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,280
You can find a pair of gloves.

19
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,280
It's not quite accurate because I saw the most useless pair of gloves.

20
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:30,920
A kind of veneer or tool-like fabric came with some lights that was installing,

21
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,360
which were awkwardly sized and overly thin.

22
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Again,

23
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
you'd have to keep getting grease

24
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:06,520
like that black garnish,

25
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:17,560
It looks completely useless for that job, let alone for keeping it warm, when it's 10

26
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
degrees up to low.

27
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
I actually had no idea.

28
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Temperature is minus 15.

29
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Depends on how cold my ears get.

30
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
If they feel they've been burning.

31
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
It's really cold.

32
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:48,560
It's not because someone's talking about them.

33
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Thank you for watching.

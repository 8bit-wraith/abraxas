0	15700	Do you think it is intentional that I try to obfuscate with myself just to make myself
15700	16700	unintelligible?
16700	41700	This is what I do when I take a break.
41700	51700	There's no such thing as sabotage.
51700	61700	Do you think that I try to obfuscate myself and refuse to make the meaning known in a
61700	74700	clear, concise fashion that's making up words that don't need to be named?
74700	85700	I don't need a word for driving by.
85700	95700	It's on a matter of payback when I already have room.
95700	96700	B-R-O-O-M.
96700	108700	Oh, and this is something that re-opened me by fogging myself.
108700	121700	There's a little bit of red and blue shift there, black and blue shift, red and blue shift.
121700	128700	Who calls doctor a better word than red, red, red, red, red, red, red and blue?
128700	136700	You can always put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put like the sounds you always find.
136700	141700	Sounds are the specifics of those sounds.
141700	146700	I don't know the colors.
146700	148700	This is the toddler, in fact.
148700	152700	Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!
152700	154700	This way.
154700	156700	Let's go down good.
158700	160700	Now, the...
161700	162700	Nope.
162700	164700	Just a minor bit higher.
164700	165700	Okay.
165700	167700	It goes...
167700	169700	Already? Nope.
173700	175700	This way.
176700	182700	It gets higher pitch when it's toward you, and it loads with wood and wood.
182700	184700	Isn't that great?
188700	192700	I'll try to explain why there's a kind of walking to take you to the world.
193700	196700	There's stoics standing in one place.
197700	201700	That's where I say we're doing this.
203700	210700	Clockwise, in other words, rotation of the up-down axis of the moving upper depth.
213700	218700	And then I say turn.
219700	223700	And I say lean.
225700	233700	I'm actually doing a kind of turning on the forward-backward axis of the moving forward-backward axis.
234700	241700	And then I say squat and move down to the up-down axis.
241700	246700	So I say jump and move up to the up-down axis.
247700	254700	And I say walk and move forward a lot of the forward-backward axis.
254700	266700	And I say start and move backwards a lot of the forward-backwards axis.
266700	273700	And I say stop and move to the lower-celevation axis.
273700	277700	And I move the forward-backward axis.
278700	282700	And I say squat and move down.
282700	289700	I say move fast and then I say walk backwards.
290700	295700	And I say turn and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.
296700	303700	And I think that maybe because of what we thought,
303700	306700	I decided in my home,
306700	310700	because there's nothing there to talk about.
313700	318700	Or I decided to go to the lower-celevation axis.
318700	320700	Nothing to do with that.
327700	334700	And I say that squat and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.
339700	345700	And I say that squat and move backwards a lot of the forward-backward axis.
345700	360700	I say it's going to take humanity 10,000 to million years to reverse engineer
360700	366700	what I'm trying to say, unless I explain it.
367700	384700	Why did I say that you make things more clear when you say there's no such thing as self-sabotage?
385700	391700	And that's the side of taking off my shoes,
391700	400700	picking them up, closing the door for which I had to bend forward
400700	408700	and stand up, which I called rotation on the left-right axis without moving left-right.
414700	428700	And then walking through the door involves moving forward along the forward-backward axis,
428700	437700	while rotating on the up-down axis without moving up or down
437700	442700	in order to open the door and close it behind me.
445700	456700	And I must have done another bow, which was a rotation on the left-right axis without moving left-right
456700	462700	because I see my shoes on the ground and I didn't hear them drop.
465700	468700	And I have a memory of putting them down.
468700	470700	That is the question.
471700	481700	So even if it were true that there were no such thing,
481700	487700	even if it were true that there was no such thing, it sounds better.
487700	495700	Even if it were true that there was no such thing as self-sabotage, it would make no sense to say it.
501700	505700	So what is parapatatic twirly walking?
505700	514700	It's where you're walking forward and then twisting on the up-down axis
516700	523700	and then moving up or down 180 degrees so that you're walking backwards,
523700	528700	which means you're continuing to move forward.
531700	538700	Even though you're facing behind, then you have to do another 180 degrees
538700	542700	in order to continue walking that line,
542700	551700	which reminds me of this joke that I came up with yesterday, or maybe it was a memory.
551700	557700	It was when I was young, I thought, talking backwards,
557700	561700	was like this.
561700	569700	When I was young, I thought talking backwards, talking backwards, was like this.
569700	571660	Was like this?
574700	578700	This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.
578700	583700	This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.
583700	587700	This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.
587700	591700	This is what I thought talking backwards sounded like when I was young.
591700	593700	Why did I think of that?
593700	602700	Because it's another example of moving forward while turning around and continuing to move in the same direction.
602700	612700	Which is another example of a spinor rotation in everyday life on macroscopic scales.
612700	626700	So, no, I don't need to actually go for a walk to feel like I'm walking.
626700	639700	Because I can wiggle like a worm and wobble like a wobble, wobble like a whoop, wobble like a worm.
639700	655700	And when I'm wobbling, wiggling, wobbling, wiggling, walking, wiggling, wiggling, walking, wiggling.
656700	664700	Is rotating on the left right axis? No, that would be correct.
664700	669700	You're moving your shoulders to the left and right.
669700	676700	Which means you're rotating on the forward-backward axis or the moving forward-back.
677700	680700	What do I mean by wiggling like a worm?
680700	690700	I meant to send a kind of sine wave down to your body.
690700	699700	Which means that we are initiating the squat and standing up again before doing some,
699700	710700	which is a kind of somewhat subtle motion up and down axis.
710700	724700	Wiggling like a worm is what I call bouncing.
724700	739700	Wiggling like a worm is what I call swimming like a dolphin rather than a fish.
739700	750700	So what can we say instead of there's no such thing as a self-sabotage?
750700	764700	We can say auto-catalytic sets self-perpetuate.
764700	774700	It's just as tautological. It's framed in a positive light.
774700	786700	And even though I am intentionally trying to remember what I'm saying, it isn't necessary as I am recording this.
786700	791700	Which means I can keep on moving forward without backtracking.
791700	800700	Because if you're trying to increase your reading speed and you've noticed that someone said that reading speed is slowed by backtracking,
800700	805700	then you try to avoid backtracking while you're trying to read.
805700	816700	And it starts to realize there's no such thing as reading without backtracking.
816700	829700	There's no such thing as bad or wrong or incorrect grammar because of synactitude and the amoral nature of grammar.
829700	837700	Amoral nature of language. Syntactitude.
837700	851700	As mentioned by Hofstadter to Dennett.
851700	856700	These are the words that I make when I am alone.
856700	860700	And I think no one is listening.
860700	865700	Which is meaningless junk, Dennett.
865700	872700	And instead of casting your prose before us, why?
872700	878700	What I used to call a junk collection of the mind.
878700	881700	Or a repository.
881700	884700	Or an archive.
884700	888700	Or an ark.
888700	890700	Or a box.
890700	893700	Or a jar.
893700	895700	Or a container.
895700	898700	Or a bowl.
898700	901700	Or a handful. Or a mouthful.
901700	905700	Or a bark.
905700	912700	And one is a bark. A bark is the sound that a dog makes.
912700	917700	There's the cortex of a tree.
917700	921700	And it is another word for boat.
921700	923700	Barko.
923700	925700	Barge.
925700	927700	An ark.
927700	929700	Bark.
929700	931700	Bakhito de pepah.
931700	933700	There's another example.
933700	937700	We say embark and disembark.
937700	941700	This to prove that bark also means boat.
941700	953700	And it can mean both the cortex of a tree.
953700	960700	And the sound of a dog makes.
960700	968700	And so, yeah, even though these words on their own are meaningless,
968700	972700	when they are put together they tell a Bakhito story.
972700	979700	This is the contextualization of narrative with optional starting and stopping.
979700	982700	And the replication crisis.
982700	987700	And the other cookie.
987700	992700	We'll see you in the next video.

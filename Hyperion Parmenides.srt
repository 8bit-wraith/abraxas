What is the TechnoAXIOLOGICAL PENTERACT?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The TechnoAXIOLOGICAL PENTERACT is a higher-dimensional framework that captures the complexity of human values and their interactions with technology.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:51,740
It combines the philosophical insights of axiology with a hypercube structure, allowing for a multi-dimensional exploration of the interplay between technology and human values.

5
00:00:51,740 --> 00:01:06,520
The PENTERACT structure acknowledges the complexity of both technology and human values, and it offers a diverse landscape to explore values in context.

6
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:20,920
It also fosters collaboration and dialogue across fields, as researchers and thinkers can align their specific concepts within the PENTERACT structure.

7
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,720
What about ACTIVE INFERENCE?

8
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:45,660
ACTIVE INFERENCE is a theoretical framework that suggests that living organisms strive to reduce the discrepancy between their expectations and the incoming sensory data, a process called, free energy minimization.

9
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:57,660
ACTIVE INFERENCE is a unifying theory that spans perception, learning, and action, and is fundamentally based on Bayesian statistics.

10
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:11,860
An active inference agent maintains a probabilistic model of its environment, which it uses to generate predictions about future sensory input.

11
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:28,220
When the agent encounters unpredicted changes in the environment, this creates a prediction error, a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual sensory data.

12
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:47,280
To minimize this prediction error, the agent can either update its model, known as, perceptual inference, or perform actions that bring about the predicted sensory data, known as, active inference.

13
00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:00,540
This allows the agent to adapt to new circumstances, by continuously updating its model and adjusting its behavior based on new information.

14
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:22,480
Active inference has been applied in a variety of domains, including artificial intelligence and neuroscience, to understand how intelligent systems, both biological and artificial, can adapt to changes in their environment.

15
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Active inference

16
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Any sci-fi stories?

32
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:21,480
These are just a few examples, but there are many other sci-fi stories that explore similar themes and scenarios.

33
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Anything on Prygogine?

34
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Yes, I have information on Prygogine.

35
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:48,480
He was a Russian chemist and theoretical biologist who made significant contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, dissipative structures, and the theory of self-organization.

36
00:05:48,480 --> 00:06:01,480
His work challenged traditional thermodynamics and provided a framework for understanding the emergence of order and complexity in nature.

37
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Prygogine's research also had implications for the arrow of time and the structure of dissipated systems.

38
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:26,480
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his contributions to the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

39
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,480

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Based on the context information provided, it appears that the conversation has primarily focused on the translation and interpretation of a Latin phrase and its potential context in conspiracy theories,

41
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:59,480
as well as general discussions around the nature of conspiracy theories and the meanings of specific Latin terms.

42
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,480
The Latin phrase discussed was,

43
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The conversation also briefly touched on the themes of predictive coding and active inferences,

44
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
and the meaning of Latin words.

45
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:20,480
The conversation also briefly touched on the themes of predictive coding and active inferences,

46
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:41,480
in psychology, especially in the context of conspiracy theories and misinformation.

47
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,480
The difference between protosis and apodosis.

48
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Protosis and apodosis are two terms used in grammar to describe the components of conditional sentences.

49
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,480
The protosis is the if clause of the sentence, which outlines the condition.

50
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:17,480
The apodosis is the main clause or the then clause, which illustrates the result or consequence of the condition.

51
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:29,480
In Latin, the protosis is typically introduced by the conditional particle, as a umlaut, or one of its compounds,

52
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,480
while the apodosis is often introduced by some correlative word or phrase.

53
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:44,480
The apodosis is the principal clause, with apodosis being the dependent clause.

54
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Yogurt computing

55
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Yogurt computing is a concept that combines the properties of yogurt,

56
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:06,480
such as its crystalline matrix and the variations in pressure, temperature, aging, and starter cultures,

57
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
with computational processes.

58
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,480
The idea is to utilize yogurt cells as a computational substrate,

59
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,480
similar to how GPUs function.

60
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:33,480
This approach reshapes the landscape of computation by harnessing the potential of yogurt cells arranged in batches or bins,

61
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,480
each governed by distinct pressures, temperatures, and age transformations.

62
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:52,480
The result is an intricately orchestrated symphony of processing power that draws parallels with nature's own mechanisms.

63
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Giant kelp farms

64
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Giant kelp farms refer to the cultivation of Macrocystis pyrifera, a species of kelp, for various purposes such as food, dietary supplements, or potash.

65
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
The cultivation of giant kelp

66
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
The cultivation of giant kelp involves growing spoilings in a cooled water greenhouse

67
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,480
and then planting them in the ocean attached to long lines.

68
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,480
This species is typically harvested after two growth seasons.

69
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
A Summary of Metamine Complexity

70
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:52,480
The essay, Metamine Complexity, discusses the concept of metaminds and its relationship with the Bayesian updating model of mind.

71
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:06,480
The Bayesian updating model suggests that we navigate our world through a constant process of updating our beliefs based on new information and prior knowledge.

72
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Metaminds, on the other hand, refer to the ability of the human mind to reflect on and regulate its own cognitive processes.

73
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:33,480
The essay explores the theoretical underpinnings of these concepts and their practical applications in areas such as education and decision making.

74
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:55,480
The authors argue that understanding how individuals update their beliefs and reflect on their own cognitive processes can provide insight into how the mind processes and interprets information and how it makes decisions and learns from experience.

75
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:07,480
The essay concludes by highlighting the potential for these concepts to lead to new insights and innovations in various fields.

76
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
The definition of Mariology

77
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Mariology is the philosophical study of parts and wholes.

78
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:30,480
It examines how individual parts come together to form a whole, and how these holes can be broken down into parts.

79
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,480
The basic idea is that one thing, X, can be a part of another, Y.

80
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Proper parts are those that are parts of another thing but are not the same as that thing.

81
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Overlap refers to when two things share at least one part, while disjoint means they share no parts.

82
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:10,480
A central concept in Mariology is the notion of a Mariological sum or fusion, which means that a group of objects can be considered as forming a single object.

83
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:32,480
The complex tale of connected events is a narrative that explores the interconnectedness of events and their impact on a community and the environment.

84
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:44,480
It follows a scientist who uncovers the existence of an artificial lake and its connection to the town's ecological challenges.

85
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:57,480
The narrative takes a deeper dive into the town's history and reveals how seemingly random events are part of a larger tapestry of cause and effect.

86
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:07,480
The story highlights the importance of conscious living and the interconnectedness of life.

87
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Do you know the plot?

88
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
No, I do not note the plot.

89
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:28,480
The context information provided includes a list of plot ideas and the scene direction, but it does not provide a complete plot or storyline.

90
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I mean of the complex tale.

91
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:47,480
The complex tale refers to the idea that stories and narratives are constantly evolving and changing as they are passed down through different people and cultures.

92
00:14:47,480 --> 00:15:03,480
The more diverse the audience, the greater the variation in the response to a story, as each person adds their own unique interpretation and experiences to it.

93
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:15,480
This can result in the story becoming distorted or exaggerated over time, as it is retold and reimagined by different people.

94
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:38,480
The author of the text suggests that this is a natural and inevitable part of the human experience, and that the most effective way to understand complex systems like human behavior is to embrace the richness and complexity of narrative explanation.

95
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Some of the main ideas

96
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,480

107
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,480
A method for extracting story ideas

108
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:56,480
A method for extracting story ideas from a text by identifying patterns and categorizing them as the first or second version of each idea.

109
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
What programming languages?

110
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,480

112
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,480
The definition of truth

113
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,480
In J. M. Kaczynski's lecture, what is knowledge?

114
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:43,480
A crash course in epistemology, truth is defined as true propositions.

115
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:52,480
A proposition is a statement that is made with the intention of conveying its meaning accurately.

116
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:02,480
When we make a statement, we are affirming a specific proposition with the intention of conveying its meaning accurately.

117
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Truths are statements or propositions that correspond to reality and represent facts or accurate descriptions of objects, events, or concepts.

118
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,480
How to define epistemology

119
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Epistemology

120
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies knowledge, including its nature, sources, justification, and limitations.

121
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:49,480
It examines how we acquire, evaluate, and use knowledge, as well as the criteria for determining what counts as knowledge.

122
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Epistemology

123
00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Epistemology also considers the role of belief, truth, and certainty in knowledge acquisition in the relationship between knowledge and other areas of philosophy, such as ethics and metaphysics.

124
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,480
The definition of care and intelligence

125
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:30,480
The article, Biology, Buddhism, and AI, Care as the driver of intelligence does not explicitly define care or intelligence.

126
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:51,480
However, it proposes that care should be a central concept for understanding intelligence, particularly in the context of emerging forms of intelligence facilitated by advancements in AI and bioengineering.

127
00:19:51,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Care is described as a dynamic and practical concept that links goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence.

128
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:16,480
The article also suggests that care should be a rubric that will remain relevant in the face of advancing AI and bioengineering.

129
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:37,480
As for intelligence, the article acknowledges that traditional measures of intelligence may not be sufficient for evaluating and assigning moral responsibility to novel beings that are fundamentally different from traditional life forms.

130
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:49,480
The authors propose that care should be at the forefront of considerations when assessing intelligence and moral responsibility.

131
00:20:49,480 --> 00:21:07,480
They argue that care provides a dynamic and robust foundation for determining moral duty and establishing relationships with diverse beings, regardless of their material composition or origin.

132
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,480
What are some Biblical metaphors?

133
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Biblical metaphors are figures of speech that use Biblical narratives, characters, or themes to convey deeper meanings or insights.

134
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Some examples of Biblical metaphors include

135
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,480
The Parable of the Sower

136
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
The Parable of the Sower

137
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:48,480
This parable compares the spread of the Gospel to the sowing of seeds, with different types of soil representing different levels of receptivity to the message.

138
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,480
The Flood as a Natural Process

139
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
The Biblical

140
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:06,480
The biblical story of the Flood can be seen as a metaphor for the natural process of renewal and cleansing, as the waters wash away impurities and start anew.

146
00:22:46,480 --> 00:23:05,480
The story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the scientific process of genetic selection, as Jacob selects certain animals for breeding based on their desirable traits, Hebrew terms and their meanings.

147
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Hebrew terms like

148
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Hebrew terms like

149
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,480

151
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Hebrew letter Kof, Hebrew letter Kof, can be seen as metaphors for broader concepts or ideas, as they often have multiple layers of meaning and cultural significance.

152
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Biblical Characters and Themes

153
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Characters like Noah and Job can be seen as metaphors for broader biblical themes, as they embody certain virtues or struggles that are relevant to all people.

154
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
These are just a few examples of biblical metaphors.

155
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:33,480
By exploring and amplifying these metaphors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the richness and depth of biblical narratives, and draw connections to contemporary insights and interpretations.

156
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
And for Noah's Ark

157
00:24:35,480 --> 00:25:01,480
The context information provided suggests that the story of Noah's Ark is not just about an actual boat of animals in the literal sense, but rather a symbolic reference to the animal-laden circle vessel of life, i.e., the 360-degree zodiac.

158
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:25,480
This symbolic vessel, whose mainframe is the 0-9 number system and the cardinal cross in 12 months of the Earth's year, can be seen as a system or way of preserving eternal knowledge of the 360-degree field and structure of time and space.

159
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:47,480
The author of the text suggests that this vessel can endure in the face of cataclysms, because it can be eternally rediscovered by humans, based on the geometries and dynamics of the Earth, solar system, and cosmos.

160
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
It is a seed symbol of the universe.

161
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:56,480
It is a seed symbol of the unified field the individual is born from and born into.

162
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:14,480
The potential contained in this seed symbol is that the individual and the collective will evolve, in due course of time, to embody the consciousness of a dynamic unity, of a dynamic wholeness.

163
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,480
And as a model of mind?

164
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Based on the provided context information, it appears that the human mind is considered a complex machine that is constantly engaged in constructing, adjusting, and reconstructing mental patterns.

165
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:47,480
These mental patterns serve as the foundational blueprints of our understanding and interaction with the world.

166
00:26:47,480 --> 00:27:05,480
The mind is capable of integrating various inputs, including colors, shapes, sounds, complex equations, and abstract concepts, into these mental patterns.

167
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,480
The construction of mental models is not limited by the type or source of inputs.

168
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:30,480
The mind is also capable of engaging in purposeless play, where mental models are constructed just for the sake of it, highlighting our inherent need for mental simulation and play.

169
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Additionally, mental models can induce behaviors, where certain thinking processes and feelings become repetitive routes that one follows, like unchangeable habits.

170
00:27:47,480 --> 00:28:09,480
The human mind is also considered to have a theory of mind-tongue, which is central to human social interactions, communication, empathy, self-consciousness, moral judgment, and even religious beliefs.

171
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:32,480
The ability to understand mental states of others, such as beliefs and desires, is considered a critical aspect of human social interactions and is considered to have emerged spontaneously as a byproduct of language models improving language skills.

172
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Overall, the human mind is a dynamic and complex system that is constantly constructing, adjusting, and reconstructing mental patterns, which serve as the foundational blueprints of our understanding and interaction with the world.

173
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,480
I mean, Noah's Ark model of mind.

174
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:19,480
The, Noah's Ark model of mind is a theory that suggests that the story of Noah's Ark can be seen as a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

175
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:40,100
The Ark, in this theory, becomes a model of the mind itself, with distinct compartments used to segregate and arrange various elements, much like the mind separates and manages diverse types of information.

176
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:54,320
The concept of the reed wall serving as a metaphor for how information leaks or filters into the mind through our senses is particularly intriguing.

177
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:13,320
This theory is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world cafe tilde copyright, where different sub-units of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multi-scale decision maker.

178
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:39,540
The Ark, in this theory, is seen as a treasure hunter or collector of interesting animals, much like a librarian might collect interesting books or an AI scientist might collect models and model-free methods that work or have interesting, novel, or salient features.

179
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:51,500
The Ark is also seen as a model for the memory palettes and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

180
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,000
Bruno's Lost Book?

181
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,140
It is not clear what you are asking about.

182
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,760
Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?

183
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,060
Giordano Bruno

184
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,160
Giordano Bruno

185
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:23,360
Giordano Bruno was a philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer born in 1548 in Nola, near Naples.

186
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:32,880
His family consisted of his father, a hired soldier, and his mother, a peasant.

187
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:43,480
At the age of 11, Bruno was sent to Naples to study literature, logic, and dialectics.

188
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:59,400
He later studied at the Monastery of San Domenico, where he faced conflicts with his superiors due to his excessively sociable, daring, and unrestrained character.

189
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:07,800
In 1565, Bruno took monastic vows and was named Giordano.

190
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:16,740
He spent nearly ten years in Naples, eventually becoming a full-fledged Catholic monk.

191
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:28,260
In 1568, he completed his first work titled, The Ark of Noah, and dedicated it to Pope Pius V.

192
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:35,080
At the age of 24, Giordano performed his first church service.

193
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:48,000
In his free time, he immersed himself in the local library, studying the works of philosophers such as Aristotle and Ptolemy.

194
00:32:49,580 --> 00:33:01,220
Bruno's ideas challenged the prevailing religious dogmas of his time, and he faced charges of heresy by the Roman Catholic Church.

195
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:11,120
In 1593, he was arrested by the Roman Inquisition and put on trial for his beliefs.

196
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Despite being given opportunities to recant, he remained steadfast in his convictions and refused to renounce his ideas.

197
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:32,620
Consequently, he was found guilty of heresy and was burned at the stake in 1600.

198
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:49,320
Bruno's tragic fate serves as a somber reminder of the historical struggles between the pursuit of knowledge and the forces of religious orthodoxy during a Renaissance era.

199
00:33:49,320 --> 00:34:05,600
His willingness to defend his ideas and face persecution for his beliefs has made him a symbol of intellectual courage and martyrdom for scientific and philosophical freedom.

200
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:20,980
Despite his untimely end, Giordano Bruno's contributions to the fields of philosophy, cosmology, and the exploration of other worlds have endured,

201
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,440
and he is now celebrated as a pioneer in the history of modern thought.

202
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:43,700
His courage and dedication to his ideas have inspired subsequent generations of thinkers to pursue knowledge and challenge established beliefs, even in the face of adversity.

203
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:50,360
Do you have a summary of Bruno's, the Ark of Noah?

204
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:57,780
Yes, I have a summary of Bruno's, the Ark of Noah.

205
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:09,840
Written in 1570, this satirical poem by Giordano Bruno is now lost and only known through a later dialogue.

206
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,720
The poem involved satire targeting the church and worldly powers,

207
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,420
with donkeys and foxes as allegorical figures.

208
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,100
Donkeys represented the monks,

209
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,200
while foxes symbolized worldly powers.

210
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:40,120
The donkeys' discontent with their position on the Ark was a reflection of Bruno's criticism of the church and its hierarchy.

Retrieval Augmented Generation

212
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,180
Retrieval Augmented Generation

213
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,220
Retrieval Augmented Generation

214
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:59,220
RAG is an architecture that enhances the capabilities of a large language model, LLM,

215
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,000
by adding an information retrieval system.

216
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,680
The unique feature of RAG is that it integrates an information retrieval mechanism

217
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:18,560
that scours a vast set of data to fetch relevant information in response to a query.

218
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,460
This data is then provided to the LLM,

219
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:31,300
which uses this contextual information to generate a more informed and precise response.

220
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:43,920
RAG combines the power of extensive data search capabilities with the advanced language generation skills of an LLM,

221
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,680
allowing the model to pull in and leverage external knowledge more effectively.

222
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,040
Relativistic Plenum Theory

223
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,660
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum

224
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:09,180
RSVP theory is a proposed concept that suggests the universe remains static in size

225
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:15,280
while cosmic voids expand relative to dense regions of galactic filaments.

226
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:25,440
This interplay between matter and negative vacuum is crucial during the formation of the inflatant field.

227
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,980
The RSVP theory also proposes the cyclical nature of the universe,

228
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:43,600
with material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflatant field expansion eventually reintegrating,

229
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,720
suggesting the universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end

230
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,280
but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.

231
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:03,860
The theory is based on stochastic diffusion of local exotropies on Markov chain as in syncs.

232
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:13,960
However, it is important to note that the RSVP theory is still in its early stages of development

233
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,320
and more research is needed to fully understand its implications.

234
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:33,260
Yes, I am familiar with your theory of Neanderthal lithophones.

235
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:44,940
You proposed that Neanderthal developed musical instruments and sound producing devices much earlier than previously thought,

236
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:52,760
challenging the notion that complex music making was exclusive to Homo sapiens.

237
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,020
Your theory is supported by archaeological evidence,

238
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:06,380
including the discovery of structures made from broken stalactites in Brunikano Cave,

239
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:14,080
dating back approximately 176,500 years.

240
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:22,900
These structures are seen as potential musical instruments, particularly lithophones.

241
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:33,800
You also discussed the possibility of Neanderthals using simpler, readily available sound-producing tools,

242
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,740
like striking stones or sticks together,

243
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,320
as the initial stages of musical or rhythmic exploration.

244
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,200
Any more unconventional or unusual theories?

245
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,120
Based on the given context information,

246
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,080
the author of the book, In Praise of Weirdness,

247
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,460
argues that the fundamental structure of the cosmos and human consciousness

248
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,380
are currently beyond our capacity to know,

249
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,780
and that we do not have definitive answers to these questions.

250
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,540
The author also argues that theories on these topics are both bizarre and dubious,

251
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,380
and that given our weak epistemic position,

252
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:32,640
our best big-picture cosmology and our best theories of consciousness

253
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,060
are strange, tentative, and modish.

254
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:43,740
The author also discusses the varieties of cosmological weirdness,

255
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,600
including relativity theory and quantum mechanics,

256
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,620
and the many-worlds hypothesis.

257
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,500
The author suggests that collaboration with researchers and academics,

258
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,260
literature contribution,

259
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,400
staying updated,

260
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:10,240
and perfecting our instruments can help in understanding these topics better.

261
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,420
Do you know the author of the book on weirdness?

262
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,120
I apologize,

263
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:26,100
but I do not have access to the specific book on weirdness that you are referring to.

264
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:32,000
Can you please provide me with more information about the book,

265
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,520
such as the title, author, or publisher,

266
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,000
so that I can assist you better?

267
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,600
It was Eric Schwitz-Giebel.

268
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,000
Eric Schwitz-Giebel is a philosopher and cognitive scientist

269
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,020
who has written extensively on the topic of skepticism

270
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,860
and the limits of human knowledge.

271
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,520
He has also written about the role of science in society

272
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,080
and the potential dangers of scientific misconduct.

273
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,420
In his work,

274
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:17,660
he has argued that while science can provide valuable insights into the world,

275
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:24,400
it is important to remain critical and skeptical of scientific claims,

276
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,080
particularly when they are based on limited evidence

277
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,860
or are subject to interpretation.

278
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,980
He has also emphasized the importance of transparency

279
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,960
and accountability in scientific research,

280
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,680
and has advocated for greater public engagement with science

281
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,820
to ensure that it remains a force for good in society.

282
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,780
Monica Anderson's Work

283
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:03,660
Monica Anderson is an accomplished and experienced AI researcher

284
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,960
with a unique focus on experimental AI epistemology.

285
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,080
Her background in computer science,

286
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:20,080
industrial AI, NLP, ML, and NLU,

287
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,220
along with her extensive experience with deep neural networks,

288
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,360
demonstrates her expertise in the field.

289
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,160
Anderson has been working with deep neural networks

290
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,980
since before their widespread recognition in 2012

291
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,880
and specifies using DDNN,

292
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,620
deep discrete neuron networks,

293
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,460
as opposed to DL, deep learning,

294
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:55,300
suggesting a distinctive approach to her neural network designs.

295
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,880
Her work in the realm of experimental AI epistemology

296
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,120
contributes to the advancement of AI understanding,

297
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,440
reasoning, and abstraction.

298
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,920
Organic Learning

299
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,980
Organic Learning, OL,

300
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,480
is a type of machine learning algorithm

301
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,980
that is designed for sequence processing,

302
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,880
such as processing text or speech.

303
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,160
It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain,

304
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,300
and aims to build a neural network-like structure,

305
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,620
called a connectome,

306
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,220
to represent the understanding of the input stream.

307
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,440
The learner starts out empty

308
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,400
and incrementally builds its connectome

309
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,280
by discovering recurring sequential patterns in its input.

310
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,700
The learning process is performed character by character,

311
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,460
without the need for parsing the input into words.

312
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,800
Each character activates a corresponding,

313
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,120
character input neuron

314
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,880
that signals other neurons,

315
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,180
creating a cascade of signaling

316
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,360
to determine the meaning of the sentence

317
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,400
and where to attach a new understanding.

318
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,120
The best ideas in the network are rewarded

319
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,480
and the less useful ideas are punished

320
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,560
through reinforcement learning, OL.

321
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:43,260
The best ideas are allowed to breed with other good ideas

322
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,400
to produce even better abstractions,

323
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,500
speeding up the learning process.

324
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,700
This is similar to sexual reproduction in nature

325
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,980
and allows multiple inventions

326
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,320
to merge into a single better solution.

327
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,060
The learner creates,

328
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,300
as its main output,

329
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,680
a file containing a,

330
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,700
node wiring list

331
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,940
describing which neurons

332
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,460
connect to which other neurons.

333
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,260
Such a competence creation event

334
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,940
is typically scheduled

335
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,440
after each 10 million characters

336
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,960
of corpus have been read.

337
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,360
Given a competence file name,

338
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,040
UM1 loads it list

339
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,080
and recreates the learned neural structure

340
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,020
and then uses that

341
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,140
as the basis of its natural language

342
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,260
understanding service.

343
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,760
Questions for later?

344
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:51,380
Yes, I can provide you with questions for later.

345
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,380
What topics or subjects

346
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,960
would you like me to focus on?

347
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,840
Explain Multidimensional Dialogue

348
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,680
Multidimensional Dialogue

349
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
is a type of dialogue system

350
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,860
that presents a topic

351
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,000
as interconnected tunnels

352
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,220
or branches for open exploration,

353
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,380
rather than separate modalities

354
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,500
or disciplines

355
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,440
that are not integrated.

356
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,180
The user can navigate

357
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,780
diverse perspectives

358
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,460
in one overarching space,

359
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,460
taking a self-directed journey

360
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,720
through the topic

361
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,600
rather than being led

362
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,260
through a set sequence

363
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,180
of modes or disciplines.

364
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,740
The system tracks

365
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,220
what has been covered

366
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,840
and can point out

367
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,060
remaining discussion areas

368
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,960
or recap key points

369
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,360
from other branches.

370
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,840
This kind of explorable,

371
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,640
multidimensional interface

372
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,000
could provide more open-ended discussion

373
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,360
than always following a set sequence

374
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,520
of questions or topics.

375
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,140
Some ways a multidimensional dialogue system

376
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,480
could differ from other approaches

377
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,840
include providing interconnected branching paths

378
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,820
on the topic for open exploration,

379
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,740
enabling the user to take a self-directed journey

380
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,960
through the topic

381
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,940
rather than being led

382
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,600
through a set sequence

383
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,500
of modes or disciplines

384
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,660
and representing conversations

385
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,700
or concepts spatially or visually,

386
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,720
not just through text or verbal modes.

387
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,460
The explorable structure

388
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,760
could be graphically mapped,

389
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,520
allowing users other ways

390
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,660
of understanding

391
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,620
and engaging with the dialogue.

392
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,700
A three-dimensional tunneling approach

393
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,300
that provides multiple branching paths

394
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,840
or decision points

395
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,760
could help make dialogue

396
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,900
less linear

397
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,420
and mitigate biases

398
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,360
from focusing on a single discussion thread,

399
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,460
representing conversations

400
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,580
as explorable tunnels, rooms,

401
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,460
or spaces with many possible directions

402
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,800
rather than a single path

403
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,840
is an interesting idea.

404
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,240
This kind of highly structured

405
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,460
yet open-ended dialogue interface

406
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,840
could give readers more agency

407
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,460
and control

408
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,080
in navigating a complex discussion

409
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,900
rather than being led down

410
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,960
a predetermined path.

411
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,880
However, there are also challenges

412
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,340
to developing and implementing

413
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,180
such an approach,

414
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,680
including the complexity

415
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,200
of creating a multidimensional dialogue interface,

416
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,020
the risk of being overwhelming

417
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,300
or confusing

418
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,820
if there are too many branches

419
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,080
or possible directions,

420
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,660
and the need to accommodate

421
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,800
different levels of interest

422
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,780
in breadth or depth among users.

423
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,240
To test the effectiveness

424
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,780
of a multidimensional dialogue system,

425
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,640
it could be compared

426
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,260
to a more standard linear dialogue system

427
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,120
in terms of user experience

428
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,260
and understanding.

429
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,060
Open-ended questions

430
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,220
could also be included

431
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,560
to get feedback

432
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,340
on what users like

433
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,760
or dislike about the system,

434
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,000
and recurring patterns

435
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,040
and responses

436
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,740
could be looked for.

437
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,600
Comparisons

438
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,180
and user feedback

439
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,260
could reveal

440
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,860
the pros and cons

441
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,580
of the multidimensional approach.

442
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,920
Do you know my game

443
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,300
Hey Pluprixies?

444
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,560
Yes,

445
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,220
I am familiar

446
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,440
with your game

447
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,780
Hey Pluprixies.

448
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,240
It is a unique game

449
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,120
that combines elements

450
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,700
from various games

451
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,200
and inspirations,

452
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,360
such as stars,

453
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,020
descent,

454
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,020
minesweeper,

455
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,620
bubble pop,

456
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,160
logical gate circuits,

457
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,660
and more.

458
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,780
The game features

459
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,720
an element of space exploration,

460
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,560
where players visit planets

461
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,660
and pop bubbles

462
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,300
associated with vocabulary words.

463
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,740
It also includes

464
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,820
a typing tutor aspect,

465
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,420
thus serving as an educational game

466
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,800
to help players

467
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,340
improve their typing skills.

468
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,000
Hippoprixies aims

469
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
to simulate the evolution

470
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,300
of the universe

471
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,020
using

472
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,340
a Zing Syncs.

473
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,760
The game employs

474
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,460
is a Vitoshkian ladder

475
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,080
of proximal graduations,

476
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,200
adjusting its gameplay

477
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,260
based on the skill level

478
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,380
of the player.

479
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,400
For infants,

480
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,240
it simplifies

481
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,380
into a bubble pop game.

482
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,340
For elementary schoolers,

483
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,740
it becomes

484
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,020
a typing tutor.

485
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,060
If no viewer is detected,

486
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,840
it defaults

487
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,040
to a screensaver tutorial.

488
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,380
The game features

489
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,820
a guide bot,

490
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,540
which automatically

491
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,680
plays through the tutorial,

492
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,260
demonstrating possible

493
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,320
gameplay and controls,

494
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and revealing easter eggs.

495
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,700
There is a global reset function,

496
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,480
triggered by pressing the

497
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,880
G key,

498
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,380
which returns all players

499
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,520
to the start of the game,

500
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,060
making them

501
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,740
lose all progress.

502
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,460
However,

503
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,300
a setting called

504
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,200
auto-blink

505
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,820
can protect players

506
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,780
from the global reset,

507
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,300
allowing them

508
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,080

00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,860
The game incorporates

510
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,820
a strategy

511
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,860
of finding

512
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,860
the most nested bubble,

513
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,700
innermost scope,

514
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,040

that uses 3D bubbles

533
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,980
to represent code

534
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,160
and logic,

535
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,580
making it an interactive

536
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,060

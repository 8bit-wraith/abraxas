Taken to an extreme, however, it can be a symptom of psychiatric dysfunction, for example, as a symptom in schizophrenia,[7] where a patient sees hostile patterns (for example, a conspiracy to persecute them) in ordinary actions.\nApophenia is also typical of conspiracy theories, where coincidences may be woven together into an apparent plot.[8]\nExamples[edit]Pareidolia[edit]\nMain article: Pareidolia\n\n\n\"The Organ Player\": an example of pareidolia in Neptune's Grotto, Sardinia\nPareidolia is a type of apophenia involving the perception of images or sounds in random stimuli.\nA common example is the perception of a face within an inanimate object—the headlights and grill of an automobile may appear to be \"grinning\". People around the world see the \"Man in the Moon\".[9] People sometimes see the face of a religious figure in a piece of toast or in the grain of a piece of wood. There is strong evidence that psychedelic drugs tend to induce or enhance pareidolia.[10]\n\nPareidolia usually occurs as a result of the fusiform face area—which is the part of the human brain responsible for seeing faces—mistakenly interpreting an object, shape or configuration with some kind of perceived \"face-like\" features as being a face."

 Docker is a platform that enables packaging and
running applications in isolated containers. These
containers are lightweight, self-contained
environments that provide security and flexibility
when running multiple containers on a single host.
Containers reduce dependencies on the host system
and allow for easy sharing and consistent execution
across different environments.

 A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and
executable package that contains everything needed
to run an application, including code, runtime,
system tools, libraries, and settings. You can build
a Docker image from a Dockerfile using the command
`docker build -t <image_name>`. To build an image
without using the cache, you can use the command
`docker build -t <image_name> . â€“no-cache`. To list
all local Docker images, you can use the command
`docker images`, and to delete a Docker image, you
can use the command `docker rmi <image_name>`. The
command `docker image prune` can be used to remove
all unused images.

 Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for
sharing and finding container images with your team.
You can log in to Docker Hub using the command
`docker login -u <username>`. To publish an image to
Docker Hub, use the command `docker push
<username>/<image_name>`. To search for an image on
Docker Hub, use the command `docker search
<image_name>`. To pull an image from Docker Hub, use
the command `docker pull <image_name>`.

 Here are some general Docker commands with a brief
description of what they do:

* `docker daemon -d`: Start the Docker daemon in
detached mode. The daemon is responsible for
managing Docker containers and images.
* `docker --help`: Display help information for
Docker. This command can also be used with specific
subcommands to get help on their usage.
* `docker info`: Display system-wide information
about Docker, including the number of containers,
images, and networks. This command can be useful for
diagnosing issues with Docker or checking its
configuration.

 A container is a runtime instance of a Docker
image, providing a consistent and isolated
environment for software to run. Here are commands
to create, manage, and inspect containers:

1. Create and run a container from an image with a
custom name:
   ```
   docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
   ```
2. Run a container with published ports:
   ```
   docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port>
<image_name>
   ```
3. Run a container in the background:
   ```
   docker run -d <image_name>
   ```
4. Start or stop an existing container:
   ```
   docker start|stop <container_name> (or
<container-id>)
   ```
5. Remove a stopped container:
   ```
   docker rm <container_name>
   ```
6. Open a shell inside a running container:
   ```
   docker exec -it <container_name> sh
   ```
7. Fetch and follow the logs of a container:
   ```
   docker logs -f <container_name>
   ```
8. Inspect a running container:
   ```
   docker inspect <container_name> (or
<container_id>)
   ```
9. List currently running containers:
   ```
   docker ps
   ```
10. List all Docker containers (running and
stopped):
    ```
    docker ps --all
    ```
11. View resource usage stats:
    ```
    docker container stats
    ```

 Docker is an open-source tool that simplifies the
deployment of applications to servers by using
resource isolation features of the Linux kernel. It
enables the creation of software containers, which
are isolated from each other and from the host
system, making it possible to easily allocate
resources and design simpler deployment pipelines
without the overhead of full-fledged virtual
machines.

Docker's architecture consists of registries,
images, containers, a Docker daemon, and a Docker
client. Registries like Docker Hub store public and
official images, while organizations can host their
private registries. Images are downloaded from
registries and cached locally; they are the
non-changing blueprints for containers. Containers
are instances of images that are running and can be
created, run, and monitored by the Docker daemon.
The Docker client communicates with the daemon via
HTTP or Unix sockets when on the same machine,
allowing for remote management as well.

The transportation industry analogy illustrates how
Docker brings similar benefits to the software
industry: just like intermodal containers
revolutionized international transportation by
standardizing and simplifying the movement of goods,
Docker simplifies the deployment and management of
applications.

 To install Docker, the official documentation
should be referred to for the most up-to-date
instructions. Docker runs natively on Linux and can
be installed using a package manager like apt-get.
For Mac OS and Windows, Docker cannot run natively
and requires the installation of an application
called Boot2Docker, which includes a VirtualBox
Virtual Machine, Docker, and management utilities.

Using Docker involves running commands that download
images from Docker Hub, start containers based on
those images, execute commands within the container,
and stop the container when the command exits. The
`docker run` command can be used for this purpose.
On first run, there may be a delay as the image is
downloaded, but if it's cached locally, subsequent
runs will be faster. Details about the last
container can be retrieved using the `docker ps -l`
command.

 This article discusses how to use Docker to deploy
a simple web server application, specifically a Java
program that handles HTTP GET requests to '/ping'
and responds with 'pong\n'. To build the Docker
image, a Dockerfile is used which specifies:

* The base image (Java 8) using the `FROM`
instruction.
* Copying the Java file into the image using the
`COPY` instruction.
* Compiling the Java file with the `RUN`
instruction.
* Exposing port 8080 using the `EXPOSE`
instruction.
* Setting the entry point and command for running
the container with the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`
instructions.

The Docker image is built by running the command
`docker build -t toptal/pingpong .`. The article
also mentions that it's a good practice to check for
existing images in registries like Docker Hub before
building your own.

 The `docker run` command is used to create and
start a new container from a Docker image. Some
common options for the `docker run` command are:

* `-d`: runs the container in detached mode, which
means it runs in the background
* `-p <host_port>:<container_port>`: maps the host's
port to the container's port so that the container
can be accessed from the host
* `-i` and `-t`: allows you to interact with the
container through a terminal session
* `--entrypoint="bash"`: overrides the default
entrypoint command of the image, allowing you to
specify a different command to run when the
container starts
* `-v <host_path>:<container_path>`: mounts a host
directory as a volume inside the container, allowing
data to persist outside of the container

* `
--link <linked_container_name>`: links one
container to another so that they can communicate
with each other.

To test if a web server application is running in a
container, you can use the `curl` command to make a
request to the container's endpoint, for example by
accessing '<http://localhost:8080/ping>' or
'$(boot2docker ip):8080/ping' depending on your
platform. If the web server is running, you should
see the response 'pong'.

 The `docker stop` command is used to stop a running
container, while the `docker start` command is used
to start a stopped container. The `docker commit`
command creates a new image from the changes made in
a container, and the `docker rm` command removes one
or more containers.

The `docker rmi` command is used to remove one or
more images, while the `docker ps` command lists all
running containers. The `docker images` command
shows all available images on the system.

Finally, the `docker exec` command lets you run a
new command in a currently running container. It can
be particularly useful for debugging purposes as it
allows you to open a terminal session inside the
container using the command:
```bash
docker exec -i -t <container-id> bash
```

 Docker is an open-source project for software
containerization, which packages applications and
their dependencies into a single container for easy
deployment. It uses the resource isolation features
of the Linux kernel to run multiple containers
within a single Linux instance, improving
performance and making development easier. The
Docker Open Source Engine has a specific
architecture, and there are also open-source tools
available for enhancing Docker security.
Additionally, Docker provides powerful tools for
managing containers, and seeking DCA certification
can be helpful in using Docker for various use cases.

 Docker Open Source is a platform for developers and
sysadmins to create, ship, and run distributed
applications using containers. The architecture of
Docker Open Source Engine consists of three major
components: the Docker Daemon, the Docker Client,
and the Docker Registries. The Docker Daemon is the
heart of the engine, managing containers and
handling requests from the Docker Client. The Docker
Client is the main interface for end-users to create
and manage containers, with both command-line and
graphical options available. Docker Registries are
used to store and distribute images, with both
public and private options available. This
architecture enables applications to be easily
assembled from components, reducing friction between
development, QA, and production environments, and
allowing for faster shipping and deployment of
applications across different clouds and data
centers.

 Docker is open-source software, but it is not free;
users can download and use the community edition for
free, but they need to pay for a subscription to use
the enterprise edition. Docker does not have to be
used with Docker Desktop, although Docker Desktop
provides an easy way to get started with many useful
tools. The key takeaway here is that while there are
free options available for using Docker, it is not
freeware, and users need to pay for certain features
and functionalities.

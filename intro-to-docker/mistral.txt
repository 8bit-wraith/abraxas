 Docker is a platform that enables the development,
packaging, and running of applications in isolated
containers. Containers provide security and allow
multiple instances to run on a single host. They are
lightweight and self-contained, requiring no
reliance on the host's software. Containers can be
easily shared, ensuring consistency across different
environments.

 Docker Desktop is a software platform available for
Mac, Linux, and Windows, which can be downloaded
from the official Docker website. It includes
built-in Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and Docker
Notary. Users can find example projects using Docker
on GitHub under the "docker/awesome-compose"
repository. For more information on how to use
Docker, refer to their documentation at
"[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com)".

 Docker images are pre-packaged and executable
software packages that include the code, runtime,
system tools, system libraries, and settings
required to run an application. You can build a
Docker image using a Dockerfile with the `docker
build` command, where you can specify the image name
with the `-t` flag. To build an image without using
the cache, use the `--no-cache` option. To list
local images, use the `docker images` command, and
to delete a specific image use the `docker rmi`
command followed by the image name. Additionally,
you can remove all unused images with the `docker
image prune` command.

 Docker Hub is a service offered by Docker for
discovering, sharing, and managing container images.
It allows users to:

1. Log in using the command `docker login -u
<username>` with their Docker Hub username.
2. Publish an image to Docker Hub with the command
`docker push <username>/<image_name>`.
3. Search for an image on Hub using the command
`docker search <image_name>`.
4. Pull an image from Docker Hub with the command
`docker pull <image_name>`.

 Containers are runtime instances of Docker images
that ensure consistent software execution across
different environments. Here's how to create, run,
and manage containers using various Docker commands:

1. Create and run a container from an image with a
custom name:
   ```
   docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
   ```
2. Run a container and publish its port(s) to the
host:
   ```
   docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port>
<image_name>
   ```
3. Run a container in the background:
   ```
   docker run -d <image_name>
   ```
4. Start, stop, or remove an existing container:
   ```
   docker start|stop <container_name> (or
<container-id>)
   docker rm <container_name>
   ```
5. Open a shell inside a running container:
   ```
   docker exec -it <container_name> sh
   ```
6. Fetch and follow the logs of a container:
   ```
   docker logs -f <container_name>
   ```
7. Inspect a running container:
   ```
   docker inspect <container_name> (or
<container_id>)
   ```
8. List currently running containers:
   ```
   docker ps
   ```
9. List all Docker containers (running and stopped):
   ```
   docker ps --all
   ```
10. View resource usage stats:
    ```
    docker container stats
    ```

 Radek Ostrowski, a verified expert in Engineering
with experience in DevOps, Linux, and Automation,
writes about getting started with Docker, a popular
open-source project used for deploying applications
inside software containers. Docker simplifies DevOps
by enabling easy application isolation, resource
allocation, and simpler deployment pipelines without
the additional overhead of virtual machines.

The article uses an analogy from the transportation
industry to explain the benefits of using Docker
containers. Just as intermodal containers have
revolutionized the way goods are transported by
allowing standardization and minimal human
intervention, Docker allows for easier and more
efficient software deployment.

Virtual machines (VMs) and Docker containers differ
in that applications running in VMs require a full
instance of the operating system and any supporting
libraries, while containers share the operating
system with the host and have minimal overheads
associated with hypervisor execution. Both
technologies have their strengths and can be used
together in systems like Boot2Docker.

The Docker architecture includes registries, images,
containers, the Docker daemon, and a Docker client.
Registries host public and official images, while
images are instances of those registries that can be
downloaded and cached locally. Containers are
running instances of images, and the Docker daemon
manages creating, running, and monitoring containers
as well as building and storing images. The Docker
client talks to the daemon via HTTP or Unix sockets
for local management.

 In summary, Docker is a platform that allows you to
easily create, deploy, and run applications by using
containers. To install Docker on Linux systems, you
can use the package manager of your distribution.
For MacOS and Windows, you need to install an
application called Boot2Docker which includes a
VirtualBox Virtual Machine and Docker itself.

The example `docker run phusion/baseimage echo
"Hello Moby Dock. Hello Molly."` explains how to use
Docker: The image 'phusion/baseimage' is downloaded
from Docker Hub (if not already in local cache), a
container based on this image is started, the
command 'echo' is executed within the container, and
the container is stopped when the command exits.
This process can result in a delay on first run as
the image needs to be downloaded. The details about
the last container can be retrieved by running
`docker ps -l`.

 In this article, the author demonstrates how to use
Docker to deploy a simple Java web server
application using a Dockerfile. The Java program
handles HTTP GET requests to '/ping' and responds
with 'pong\n'. Before creating a Docker image, the
author checks for existing ones in Docker Hub or
private registries. They then write a Dockerfile
using an official Java 8 image as the base. In the
Dockerfile, they copy the Java file into the image,
compile it, expose port 8080, and set the entrypoint
and command. The author builds the image using the
`docker build` command with the tag
`toptal/pingpong`. The article emphasizes following
best practices for writing Dockerfiles as documented
in the official Docker documentation.

 In this text, the author is explaining how to run a
Docker container using the `docker run` command.
They start by describing how to run the container in
the background as a daemon process and map ports for
accessing the web server application.

Next, they cover running the container in an
interactive mode and overriding the entrypoint
command to have a bash terminal session. The author
then discusses various options like persisting data
outside of the container using the host filesystem
(`-v`), linking containers together, and sharing
volumes with read/write or read-only access.

Key points:

1. Running a container in the background (daemon
process) using `docker run -d -p 8080:8080
toptal/pingpong`
2. Interactive mode and overriding entrypoint
command: `docker run -i -t --entrypoint="bash"
toptal/pingpong`
3. Persisting data outside the container using the
host filesystem (`-v`) with read-write access:
`docker run -v
/Users/$USER/.m2/repository:/home/user/.m2/repository/Users/$USER/.m2/repository:/home/user.m2/repository toptal/pingpong`
4. Linking containers together for communication
without exposing ports: `docker run -p 9999:8080
--link otherContainerA --link otherContainerB
toptal/pingpong`.

 In summary, Docker provides various container and
image operations besides build and run. These
include:

1. stop - Stops a running container.
2. start - Starts a stopped container.
3. commit - Creates a new image from a container's
changes.
4. rm - Removes one or more containers.
5. rmi - Removes one or more images.
6. ps - Lists containers.
7. images - Lists images.
8. exec - Runs a command in a running container.

The last operation, 'exec,' is particularly useful
for debugging purposes as it lets you connect to the
terminal of a running container (using the commands
'docker exec -i -t <container-id> bash').

 In this article, we will discuss Docker Open
Source, its architecture, and the tools it provides
for managing containers. Docker is a popular
open-source project for software containerization
that has gained significant traction in the
development community. It packages an application
and all its dependencies into a single container,
making it easy to deploy and run on any machine.
Docker utilizes Linux kernel features like cgroups
and namespaces for resource isolation, improving
performance and simplifying development. This
article will also introduce some powerful tools
provided by Docker for managing containers and
mention Open Source Tools for Docker Security. For
those seeking certification, it's important to
understand the basics of Docker before using
advanced tools like budibase or airbyte with docker
images.

 Docker is an open source platform for creating,
shipping, and executing distributed applications.
The architecture of the Docker Open Source Engine
includes three major components:

1. The Docker Daemon: a long-running process
managing containers, handling requests from the
client, and providing interfaces to other parts of
the system. It is written in Go and can be
configured using a json file or command line
arguments.
2. The Docker Client: an interface for end users to
interact with Docker using a CLI, which communicates
with the daemon to create and manage containers.
There's also a graphical user interface provided by
third-party tools.
3. Docker Registries: used to store and distribute
images, available as public or private, requiring
subscriptions for access and only accessible to
authorized users respectively.

Checking docker-open-source-3.txt
 Docker offers several storage drivers for
containers, including Devicemapper, Fuse-overlayfs,
Aufs, Btrfs, Zfs, Vfs, and Overlay2. Each driver has
unique features and capabilities:

1. Devicemapper: The original storage driver for
Docker, with support for thin provisioning and used
by Kubernetes.
2. Fuse-overlayfs: An open-source driver that
provides additional features like multiple storage
backends, snapshotting, and advanced container
management.
3. Aufs: A copy-on-write driver that uses a merge
filesystem and is the default in most Linux
distributions. It supports multiple open source
container registries and is included in the stable
release of the Linux kernel.
4. Btrfs and Zfs: Two popular storage drivers based
on their respective filesystems, offering excellent
performance and scalability features. Both drivers
are available under Docker's open-source license.
5. Vfs: The default open-source driver that offers
good performance and isolation but is less flexible
than other drivers. It is best suited for
development and testing environments.
6. Overlay2: The preferred storage driver,
supporting multiple lower-layer storage options and
having good performance with features like
snapshotting and cloning. It has been the default
since Docker 18.06.

 Docker offers several open-source tools to enhance
the security of your containers:

1. **Docker Bench for Security**: This tool checks
the security of running Docker containers against a
set of best practices and CIS Benchmark for Docker.
It performs checks related to exposed daemon
sockets, insecure permissions on Docker volumes,
etc.

2. **Clair**: Clair is a vulnerability scanner that
analyzes container images statically. It scans
containers for known vulnerabilities in their
packages and reports the affected package and
version. This information can be used to create
security policies that restrict which containers can
run on a host.

3. **Notary**: Notary is an image verification tool
that uses cryptographic signatures to ensure Docker
images have not been tampered with. It supports both
local signing and verification of open-source
registry images.

4. **Dagda**: Dagda provides detailed information
about the contents of Docker images, including
vulnerabilities and exposed ports. It supports both
Dockerfile and OCI image formats and can be used to
scan for malware and monitor containers for
suspicious activity.

5. **Anchore**: Anchore is an open-source tool that
monitors and analyzes Docker images for security
vulnerabilities. It scans the contents of a Docker
image against a database of known vulnerabilities,
reporting any vulnerabilities found to be addressed.
Additionally, it offers features like image signing
and policy enforcement.

 Docker is an open source platform for developing,
shipping, and running applications using containers.
The architecture of Docker allows developers to
create portable applications that can run anywhere.
For securing Docker containers, there are several
open source tools available.

Trivy is a static analysis tool that scans Docker
images for vulnerabilities and malware, and can be
run inside containers. OpenSCAP Workbench is a
graphical interface for analyzing and remediating
security vulnerabilities in Docker containers and
managing security policies. Sysdig Falco monitors
container activity at the kernel level to detect
suspicious behavior. Grafaes provides a web-based
interface for managing Docker images and containers,
integrates with other open source tools, and
includes features for auditing container activity.
Cilium offers network security, visibility, and load
balancing for containers and microservices using BPF
programs attached to each container.

These tools help businesses deploy containers
securely and confidently. Understanding the Docker
architecture and these tools is essential for
developers looking to build applications using
Docker.

 Docker is open source but not completely free as it
offers a community edition that can be used for free
and a paid enterprise edition. Docker is not
freeware. It's possible to install docker without
docker desktop, but docker desktop makes getting
started easier with added tools. Docker itself is
free without docker desktop.

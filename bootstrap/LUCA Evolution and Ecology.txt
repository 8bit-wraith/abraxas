The nature of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), its age and its impact 
on the Earth system have been the subject of vigorous debate across diverse 
disciplines, often based on disparate data and methods. Age estimates for LUCA 
are usually based on the fossil record, varying with every reinterpretation. 
The nature of LUCA's metabolism has proven equally contentious, with some 
attributing all core metabolisms to LUCA, whereas others reconstruct a 
simpler life form dependent on geochemistry. Here we infer that LUCA lived 
~4.2 Ga (4.09-4.33 Ga) through divergence time analysis of pre-LUCA gene 
duplicates, calibrated using microbial fossils and isotope records under a 
new cross-bracing implementation. Phylogenetic reconciliation suggests 
that LUCA had a genome of at least 2.5 Mb (2.49-2.99 Mb), encoding around 
2,600 proteins, comparable to modern prokaryotes. Our results suggest 
LUCA was a prokaryote-grade anaerobic acetogen that possessed an 
early immune system. Although LUCA is sometimes perceived as living in 
isolation, we infer LUCA to have been part of an established ecological system. 
The metabolism of LUCA would have provided a niche for other microbial 
community members and hydrogen recycling by atmospheric photo-
chemistry could have supported a modestly productive early ecosystem.
The common ancestry of all extant cellular life is evidenced by the uni-
versal genetic code, machinery for protein synthesis, shared chirality 
of the almost-universal set of 20 amino acids and use of ATP as a com-
mon energy currency1
. The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is 
the node on the tree of life from which the fundamental prokaryotic 
domains (Archaea and Bacteria) diverge. As such, our understanding of 
LUCA impacts our understanding of the early evolution of life on Earth. 
Was LUCA a simple or complex organism? What kind of environment did 
it inhabit and when? Previous estimates of LUCA are in conflict either 
due to conceptual disagreement about what LUCA is2
 or as a result of dif-
ferent methodological approaches and data3-9
. Published analyses dif-
fer in their inferences of LUCA's genome, from conservative estimates of 
80 orthologous proteins10 up to 1,529 different potential gene families4
. 
Interpretations range from little beyond an information-processing 
and metabolic core6
 through to a prokaryote-grade organism with 
much of the gene repertoire of modern Archaea and Bacteria8

Key Findings
Age of LUCA
:
LUCA is estimated to have lived around
4.2 billion years ago
(confidence interval:
4.09-4.33 Ga
), placing it
shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment
and earlier than many previous estimates.
Genome Complexity
:
LUCA likely had a
genome of ~2.5 Mb
, encoding approximately
2,600 proteins
, making it
genetically comparable to modern prokaryotes
in complexity.
Metabolic Profile
:
LUCA is inferred to have been an
anaerobic acetogen
, meaning it used
CO₂ and H₂
to produce
acetate
—a metabolism consistent with life in
hydrothermal or geochemically active environments
.
Immune and Community Function
:
Surprisingly, LUCA may have had an
early immune system
, indicating
exposure to viral predation or gene transfer
pressures.
Rather than being isolated, LUCA
lived within a microbial community
, interacting ecologically with others in a
hydrogen-cycling ecosystem
potentially supported by
atmospheric photochemistry
.
Methodological Innovation
:
The paper introduces a
"cross-bracing" calibration method
, integrating fossil evidence (e.g., microbial fossils and isotope data) into divergence time estimation, resolving prior discrepancies.
Implications for Early Earth and Life:
Ecological Complexity
: LUCA was
not a primitive lone survivor
, but part of a
diverse, interacting microbial ecosystem
.
Biosphere Feedback
: Its metabolism likely contributed to
early Earth's geochemical cycles
, such as the
carbon and hydrogen cycles
.
Revises Origin-of-Life Models
: Supports
geochemically informed origin scenarios
, such as
alkaline hydrothermal vent models
, over more minimalist "RNA world" models for LUCA.

(ILN)31,32 relaxed-clock models with our partitioned dataset (GBM, 
4.18-4.33 Ga; ILN, 4.09-4.32 Ga; Fig. 1) fall within our composite age 
estimate for LUCA ranging from 3.94 Ga to 4.52 Ga, comparable to pre-
vious studies13,18,33. Dating analyses based on single genes, or concatena-
tions that excluded each gene in turn, returned compatible timescales 
(Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2 and 'Additional methods' in Methods).
LUCA's physiology
To estimate the physiology of LUCA, we first inferred an updated micro-
bial phylogeny from 57 phylogenetic marker genes (see 'Universal 
marker genes' in Methods) on 700 genomes, comprising 350 Archaea 
and 350 Bacteria15. This tree was in good agreement with recent phylo-
genies of the archaeal and bacterial domains of life34,35. For example, 
the TACK36 and Asgard clades of Archaea37-39 and Gracilicutes within 
Bacteria40,41 were recovered as monophyletic. However, the analysis 
was equivocal as to the phylogenetic placement of the Patescibacteria 
(CPR)42 and DPANN43, which are two small-genome lineages that have 
been difficult to place in trees. Approximately unbiased44 tests could 
not distinguish the placement of these clades, neither at the root of 
their respective domains nor in derived positions, with CPR sister to 
Chloroflexota (as reported recently in refs. 35,41,45) and DPANN sister 
to Euryarchaeota. To account for this phylogenetic uncertainty, we 
performed LUCA reconstructions on two trees: our maximum likeli-
hood (ML) tree (topology 1; Extended Data Fig. 3) and a tree in which 
CPR were placed as the sister of Chloroflexota, with DPANN sister to all 
other Archaea (topology 2; Extended Data Fig. 4). In both cases, the gene 
families mapped to LUCA were very similar (correlation of LUCA pres-
ence probabilities (PP), r = 0.6720275, P < 2.2 × 10−
16). We discuss the 
results on the tree with topology 2 and discuss the residual differences 
in Supplementary Information, 'Topology 1' (Supplementary Data 1).
We used the probabilistic gene- and species-tree reconciliation 
algorithm ALE46 to infer the evolution of gene family trees for each 
sampled entry in the KEGG Orthology (KO) database47 on our species 
tree. ALE infers the history of gene duplications, transfers and losses 
based on a comparison between a distribution of bootstrapped gene 
trees and the reference species tree, allowing us to estimate the prob-
ability that the gene family was present at a node in the tree35,48,49. This 
reconciliation approach has several advantages for drawing inferences 
about LUCA. Most gene families have experienced gene transfer since 
the time of LUCA50,51 and so explicitly modelling transfers enables us 
to include many more gene families in the analysis than has been pos-
sible using previous approaches. As the analysis is probabilistic, we can 
also account for uncertainty in gene family origins and evolutionary 
history by averaging over different scenarios using the reconcilia-
tion model. Using this approach, we estimated the probability that 
each KEGG gene family (KO) was present in LUCA and then used the 
resulting probabilities to construct a hypothetical model of LUCA's 
gene content, metabolic potential (Fig. 2) and environmental context 
(Fig. 3). Using the KEGG annotation is beneficial because it allows us to 
connect our inferences to curated functional annotations; however, it 
has the drawback that some widespread gene families that were likely 
present in LUCA are divided into multiple KO families that individually 
appear to be restricted to particular taxonomic groups and inferred 
to have arisen later. To account for this limitation, we also performed 
an analysis of COG (Clusters of Orthologous Genes)52 gene families, 
which correspond to more coarse-grained functional annotations 
(Supplementary Data 2).
Genome size and cellular features
By using modern prokaryotic genomes as training data, we used a pre-
dictive model to estimate the genome size and the number of protein 
families encoded by LUCA based on the relationship between the num-
ber of KEGG gene families and the total number of proteins encoded 
by modern prokaryote genomes (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). On the 
basis of the PPs for KEGG KO gene families, we identified a conservative 
reviewed in ref. 7. Here we use molecular clock methodology, horizontal 
gene-transfer-aware phylogenetic reconciliation and existing biogeo-
chemical models to address questions about LUCA's age, gene content, 
metabolism and impact on the early Earth system.
Estimating the age of LUCA
Life's evolutionary timescale is typically calibrated to the oldest 
fossil occurrences. However, the veracity of fossil discoveries from 
the early Archaean period has been contested11,12. Relaxed Bayesian 
node-calibrated molecular clock approaches provide a means of inte-
grating the sparse fossil and geochemical record of early life with the 
information provided by molecular data; however, constraining LUCA's 
age is challenging due to limited prokaryote fossil calibrations and 
the uncertainty in their placement on the phylogeny. Molecular clock 
estimates of LUCA13-15 have relied on conserved universal single-copy 
marker genes within phylogenies for which LUCA represented the root. 
Dating the root of a tree is difficult because errors propagate from the 
tips to the root of the dated phylogeny and information is not available 
to estimate the rate of evolution for the branch incident on the root 
node. Therefore, we analysed genes that duplicated before LUCA with 
two (or more) copies in LUCA's genome16. The root in these gene trees 
represents this duplication preceding LUCA, whereas LUCA is repre-
sented by two descendant nodes. Use of these universal paralogues 
also has the advantage that the same calibrations can be applied at least 
twice. After duplication, the same species divergences are represented 
on both sides of the gene tree17,18 and thus can be assumed to have the 
same age. This considerably reduces the uncertainty when genetic 
distance (branch length) is resolved into absolute time and rate. When 
a shared node is assigned a fossil calibration, such cross-bracing also 
serves to double the number of calibrations on the phylogeny, improv-
ing divergence time estimates. We calibrated our molecular clock analy-
ses using 13 calibrations (see 'Fossil calibrations' in Supplementary 
Information). The calibration on the root of the tree of life is of particu-
lar importance. Some previous studies have placed a younger maximum 
constraint on the age of LUCA based on the assumption that life could 
not have survived Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) (~3.7-3.9 billion 
years ago (Ga))19. However, the LHB hypothesis is extrapolated and 
scaled from the Moon's impact record, the interpretation of which 
has been questioned in terms of the intensity, duration and even the 
veracity of an LHB episode20-23. Thus, the LHB hypothesis should not be 
considered a credible maximum constraint on the age of LUCA. We used 
soft-uniform bounds, with the maximum-age bound based on the time 
of the Moon-forming impact (4,510 million years ago (Ma) ± 10 Myr), 
which would have effectively sterilized Earth's precursors, Tellus and 
Theia13. Our minimum bound on the age of LUCA is based on low δ98Mo 
isotope values indicative of Mn oxidation compatible with oxygenic 
photosynthesis and, therefore, total-group Oxyphotobacteria in the 
Mozaan Group, Pongola Supergroup, South Africa24,25, dated minimally 
to 2,954 Ma ± 9 Myr (ref. 26).
Our estimates for the age of LUCA are inferred with a concatenated 
and a partitioned dataset, both consisting of five pre-LUCA paralogues: 
catalytic and non-catalytic subunits from ATP synthases, elongation 
factor Tu and G, signal recognition protein and signal recognition par-
ticle receptor, tyrosyl-tRNA and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases, and 
leucyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases27. Marginal densities (commonly 
referred to as effective priors) fall within calibration densities (that 
is, user-specified priors) when topologically adjacent calibrations do 
not overlap temporally, but may differ when they overlap, to ensure 
the relative age relationships between ancestor-descendant nodes. 
We consider the marginal densities a reasonable interpretation of the 
calibration evidence given the phylogeny; we are not attempting to test 
the hypothesis that the fossil record is an accurate temporal archive 
of evolutionary history because it is not28. The duplicated LUCA node

This extended excerpt offers a deeper technical view into
Moody et al.'s (2024)
paper on LUCA, emphasizing the
phylogenetic, genomic, and geochemical methods
used to reconstruct its age, physiology, and environmental role.
Below is a structured summary of the newly introduced content:
1. Age Estimation Methodology
Gene Duplication Strategy
:
Rather than rooting the tree with universal single-copy genes (which propagate uncertainty), the authors analyzed
five pre-LUCA gene duplicates
. This allows
internal calibration
of LUCA by anchoring each duplicated pair within the tree.
Cross-Bracing Calibration
:
By identifying
shared species divergence events
across both branches of each duplicate gene pair,
the same fossil calibration
can be applied multiple times, reducing uncertainty and increasing robustness.
Clock Models Used
:
GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion)
: 4.18-4.33 Ga
ILN (Independent Log-Normal)
: 4.09-4.32 Ga
These span a
composite range of ~3.94-4.52 Ga
,
pushing LUCA's origin close to Earth's formation
(~4.51 Ga).
Calibrations
:
The
maximum age constraint
was set near the
Moon-forming impact (4.51 Ga)
, rejecting the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) as a valid upper bound.
The
minimum constraint
came from molybdenum isotope evidence of
oxygenic photosynthesis ~2.95 Ga
, anchoring the lower bound.
2. Phylogenetic Reconstruction
Used
57 universal marker genes
from 700 genomes (350 Archaea, 350 Bacteria).
Recovered
monophyletic clades
: TACK and Asgard (Archaea), Gracilicutes (Bacteria).
Placement of
CPR and DPANN lineages
remains uncertain, so the team analyzed
two alternative tree topologies
, showing strong
concordance (r = 0.67, p < 2.2e−16)
in LUCA gene predictions.
3. Probabilistic Ancestral Reconstruction
Employed the
ALE (Amalgamated Likelihood Estimation)
algorithm to reconcile gene trees with the species tree.
ALE models
gene duplications, losses, and horizontal transfers
, making it more accurate than prior static presence/absence methods.
Mapped
KEGG Orthology (KO)
gene families to LUCA, complemented by
COG analysis
to mitigate functional fragmentation across KOs.
4. Physiology and Genomic Profile of LUCA
Predicted genome size
: ~2.5-3.0 Mb
Estimated proteome
: ~2,600 proteins
Physiological inferences:
Anaerobic acetogen
: Metabolized
H₂ and CO₂
to generate acetate.
Possibly had
rudimentary immune mechanisms
, suggesting interaction with mobile genetic elements (e.g., phages).
Lived in a
microbial ecosystem
, not in isolation.
5. Broader Implications
Rejects minimalist models
of LUCA as a proto-cell or information-only core.
Instead supports a view of LUCA as a
functionally integrated, prokaryote-grade organism
with ecological context and metabolic specificity.
Validates geochemical hypotheses like the
alkaline hydrothermal vent theory
.

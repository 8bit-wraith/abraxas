14040	20000	What is the TechnoAXIOLOGICAL PENTERACT?
20000	35000	The TechnoAXIOLOGICAL PENTERACT is a higher-dimensional framework that captures the complexity of human values and their interactions with technology.
35000	51740	It combines the philosophical insights of axiology with a hypercube structure, allowing for a multi-dimensional exploration of the interplay between technology and human values.
51740	66520	The PENTERACT structure acknowledges the complexity of both technology and human values, and it offers a diverse landscape to explore values in context.
66520	80920	It also fosters collaboration and dialogue across fields, as researchers and thinkers can align their specific concepts within the PENTERACT structure.
81740	84720	What about ACTIVE INFERENCE?
85680	105660	ACTIVE INFERENCE is a theoretical framework that suggests that living organisms strive to reduce the discrepancy between their expectations and the incoming sensory data, a process called, free energy minimization.
105660	117660	ACTIVE INFERENCE is a unifying theory that spans perception, learning, and action, and is fundamentally based on Bayesian statistics.
117660	131860	An active inference agent maintains a probabilistic model of its environment, which it uses to generate predictions about future sensory input.
131860	148220	When the agent encounters unpredicted changes in the environment, this creates a prediction error, a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual sensory data.
148220	167280	To minimize this prediction error, the agent can either update its model, known as, perceptual inference, or perform actions that bring about the predicted sensory data, known as, active inference.
167280	180540	This allows the agent to adapt to new circumstances, by continuously updating its model and adjusting its behavior based on new information.
180540	202480	Active inference has been applied in a variety of domains, including artificial intelligence and neuroscience, to understand how intelligent systems, both biological and artificial, can adapt to changes in their environment.
202480	204480	Active inference
204480	206480	Any sci-fi stories?
206480	215480	Yes, there are many sci-fi stories that explore various themes and concepts.

290480	291480	The Quantum Conclave
291480	309480	A group of scientists and philosophers convene in an isolated research facility to delve into the depths of quantum theory, uncovering profound truths about the nature of reality in consciousness.
309480	321480	These are just a few examples, but there are many other sci-fi stories that explore similar themes and scenarios.
321480	325480	Anything on Prygogine?
325480	330480	Yes, I have information on Prygogine.
330480	348480	He was a Russian chemist and theoretical biologist who made significant contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, dissipative structures, and the theory of self-organization.
348480	361480	His work challenged traditional thermodynamics and provided a framework for understanding the emergence of order and complexity in nature.
361480	371480	Prygogine's research also had implications for the arrow of time and the structure of dissipated systems.
371480	386480	He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his contributions to the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
386480	389480	Latin Phrases
389480	409480	Based on the context information provided, it appears that the conversation has primarily focused on the translation and interpretation of a Latin phrase and its potential context in conspiracy theories,
409480	419480	as well as general discussions around the nature of conspiracy theories and the meanings of specific Latin terms.
419480	423480	The Latin phrase discussed was,
423480	430480	The conversation also briefly touched on the themes of predictive coding and active inferences,
430480	432480	and the meaning of Latin words.
432480	440480	The conversation also briefly touched on the themes of predictive coding and active inferences,
440480	461480	in psychology, especially in the context of conspiracy theories and misinformation.
461480	468480	The difference between protosis and apodosis.
468480	478480	Protosis and apodosis are two terms used in grammar to describe the components of conditional sentences.
478480	486480	The protosis is the if clause of the sentence, which outlines the condition.
486480	497480	The apodosis is the main clause or the then clause, which illustrates the result or consequence of the condition.
497480	509480	In Latin, the protosis is typically introduced by the conditional particle, as a umlaut, or one of its compounds,
509480	516480	while the apodosis is often introduced by some correlative word or phrase.
516480	524480	The apodosis is the principal clause, with apodosis being the dependent clause.
524480	528480	Yogurt computing
528480	535480	Yogurt computing is a concept that combines the properties of yogurt,
535480	546480	such as its crystalline matrix and the variations in pressure, temperature, aging, and starter cultures,
546480	550480	with computational processes.
550480	557480	The idea is to utilize yogurt cells as a computational substrate,
557480	561480	similar to how GPUs function.
561480	573480	This approach reshapes the landscape of computation by harnessing the potential of yogurt cells arranged in batches or bins,
573480	580480	each governed by distinct pressures, temperatures, and age transformations.
580480	592480	The result is an intricately orchestrated symphony of processing power that draws parallels with nature's own mechanisms.
592480	596480	Giant kelp farms
596480	614480	Giant kelp farms refer to the cultivation of Macrocystis pyrifera, a species of kelp, for various purposes such as food, dietary supplements, or potash.
614480	618480	The cultivation of giant kelp
618480	622480	The cultivation of giant kelp involves growing spoilings in a cooled water greenhouse
622480	627480	and then planting them in the ocean attached to long lines.
627480	633480	This species is typically harvested after two growth seasons.
633480	638480	A Summary of Metamine Complexity
638480	652480	The essay, Metamine Complexity, discusses the concept of metaminds and its relationship with the Bayesian updating model of mind.
652480	666480	The Bayesian updating model suggests that we navigate our world through a constant process of updating our beliefs based on new information and prior knowledge.
666480	679480	Metaminds, on the other hand, refer to the ability of the human mind to reflect on and regulate its own cognitive processes.
679480	693480	The essay explores the theoretical underpinnings of these concepts and their practical applications in areas such as education and decision making.
693480	715480	The authors argue that understanding how individuals update their beliefs and reflect on their own cognitive processes can provide insight into how the mind processes and interprets information and how it makes decisions and learns from experience.
715480	727480	The essay concludes by highlighting the potential for these concepts to lead to new insights and innovations in various fields.
727480	732480	The definition of Mariology
732480	738480	Mariology is the philosophical study of parts and wholes.
738480	750480	It examines how individual parts come together to form a whole, and how these holes can be broken down into parts.
750480	758480	The basic idea is that one thing, X, can be a part of another, Y.
758480	765480	Proper parts are those that are parts of another thing but are not the same as that thing.
765480	775480	Overlap refers to when two things share at least one part, while disjoint means they share no parts.
775480	790480	A central concept in Mariology is the notion of a Mariological sum or fusion, which means that a group of objects can be considered as forming a single object.
790480	812480	The complex tale of connected events is a narrative that explores the interconnectedness of events and their impact on a community and the environment.
812480	824480	It follows a scientist who uncovers the existence of an artificial lake and its connection to the town's ecological challenges.
824480	837480	The narrative takes a deeper dive into the town's history and reveals how seemingly random events are part of a larger tapestry of cause and effect.
837480	847480	The story highlights the importance of conscious living and the interconnectedness of life.
847480	850480	Do you know the plot?
850480	854480	No, I do not note the plot.
854480	868480	The context information provided includes a list of plot ideas and the scene direction, but it does not provide a complete plot or storyline.
868480	872480	I mean of the complex tale.
872480	887480	The complex tale refers to the idea that stories and narratives are constantly evolving and changing as they are passed down through different people and cultures.
887480	903480	The more diverse the audience, the greater the variation in the response to a story, as each person adds their own unique interpretation and experiences to it.
903480	915480	This can result in the story becoming distorted or exaggerated over time, as it is retold and reimagined by different people.
915480	938480	The author of the text suggests that this is a natural and inevitable part of the human experience, and that the most effective way to understand complex systems like human behavior is to embrace the richness and complexity of narrative explanation.
938480	943480	Some of the main ideas
943480	948480	The main ideas discussed in the context information are
948480	951480	Introspection

1046480	1050480	The definition of truth
1050480	1055480	In J. M. Kaczynski's lecture, what is knowledge?
1055480	1063480	A crash course in epistemology, truth is defined as true propositions.
1063480	1072480	A proposition is a statement that is made with the intention of conveying its meaning accurately.
1072480	1082480	When we make a statement, we are affirming a specific proposition with the intention of conveying its meaning accurately.
1082480	1097480	Truths are statements or propositions that correspond to reality and represent facts or accurate descriptions of objects, events, or concepts.
1097480	1101480	How to define epistemology
1101480	1104480	Epistemology
1104480	1117480	Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies knowledge, including its nature, sources, justification, and limitations.
1117480	1129480	It examines how we acquire, evaluate, and use knowledge, as well as the criteria for determining what counts as knowledge.
1129480	1131480	Epistemology
1131480	1148480	Epistemology also considers the role of belief, truth, and certainty in knowledge acquisition in the relationship between knowledge and other areas of philosophy, such as ethics and metaphysics.
1148480	1155480	The definition of care and intelligence
1155480	1170480	The article, Biology, Buddhism, and AI, Care as the driver of intelligence does not explicitly define care or intelligence.
1170480	1191480	However, it proposes that care should be a central concept for understanding intelligence, particularly in the context of emerging forms of intelligence facilitated by advancements in AI and bioengineering.
1191480	1203480	Care is described as a dynamic and practical concept that links goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence.
1203480	1216480	The article also suggests that care should be a rubric that will remain relevant in the face of advancing AI and bioengineering.
1216480	1237480	As for intelligence, the article acknowledges that traditional measures of intelligence may not be sufficient for evaluating and assigning moral responsibility to novel beings that are fundamentally different from traditional life forms.
1237480	1249480	The authors propose that care should be at the forefront of considerations when assessing intelligence and moral responsibility.
1249480	1267480	They argue that care provides a dynamic and robust foundation for determining moral duty and establishing relationships with diverse beings, regardless of their material composition or origin.
1267480	1272480	What are some Biblical metaphors?
1272480	1285480	Biblical metaphors are figures of speech that use Biblical narratives, characters, or themes to convey deeper meanings or insights.
1285480	1290480	Some examples of Biblical metaphors include
1290480	1293480	The Parable of the Sower
1293480	1294480	The Parable of the Sower
1294480	1308480	This parable compares the spread of the Gospel to the sowing of seeds, with different types of soil representing different levels of receptivity to the message.
1308480	1311480	The Flood as a Natural Process
1311480	1312480	The Biblical
1312480	1326480	The biblical story of the Flood can be seen as a metaphor for the natural process of renewal and cleansing, as the waters wash away impurities and start anew.
1326480	1328480	Gideon's Fleece
1328480	1344480	The story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the scientific method, as Gideon tests the authenticity of a fleece by asking God to make it wet with dew or dry with heat.
1344480	1347480	Elijah's Altar
1347480	1364480	The story can also be seen as a metaphor for the scientific method, as Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal to build an altar that can withstand fire without being consumed.
1364480	1366480	Jacob's Breeding Techniques
1366480	1385480	The story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the scientific process of genetic selection, as Jacob selects certain animals for breeding based on their desirable traits, Hebrew terms and their meanings.
1385480	1387480	Hebrew terms like
1387480	1388480	Hebrew terms like
1388480	1395480	Hebrew letter Kof, Hebrew point Zir, Hebrew letter Final Nun, Ken
1395480	1409480	Hebrew letter Gimel, Hebrew point Dejish or Mopic, Hebrew letter Pei, Hebrew point Segal, Hebrew letter Resh, Gopher, and
1409480	1430480	Hebrew letter Kof, Hebrew letter Kof, can be seen as metaphors for broader concepts or ideas, as they often have multiple layers of meaning and cultural significance.
1430480	1433480	Biblical Characters and Themes
1433480	1448480	Characters like Noah and Job can be seen as metaphors for broader biblical themes, as they embody certain virtues or struggles that are relevant to all people.
1448480	1454480	These are just a few examples of biblical metaphors.
1454480	1473480	By exploring and amplifying these metaphors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the richness and depth of biblical narratives, and draw connections to contemporary insights and interpretations.
1473480	1475480	And for Noah's Ark
1475480	1501480	The context information provided suggests that the story of Noah's Ark is not just about an actual boat of animals in the literal sense, but rather a symbolic reference to the animal-laden circle vessel of life, i.e., the 360-degree zodiac.
1501480	1525480	This symbolic vessel, whose mainframe is the 0-9 number system and the cardinal cross in 12 months of the Earth's year, can be seen as a system or way of preserving eternal knowledge of the 360-degree field and structure of time and space.
1525480	1547480	The author of the text suggests that this vessel can endure in the face of cataclysms, because it can be eternally rediscovered by humans, based on the geometries and dynamics of the Earth, solar system, and cosmos.
1547480	1548480	It is a seed symbol of the universe.
1548480	1556480	It is a seed symbol of the unified field the individual is born from and born into.
1556480	1574480	The potential contained in this seed symbol is that the individual and the collective will evolve, in due course of time, to embody the consciousness of a dynamic unity, of a dynamic wholeness.
1574480	1577480	And as a model of mind?
1577480	1597480	Based on the provided context information, it appears that the human mind is considered a complex machine that is constantly engaged in constructing, adjusting, and reconstructing mental patterns.
1597480	1607480	These mental patterns serve as the foundational blueprints of our understanding and interaction with the world.
1607480	1625480	The mind is capable of integrating various inputs, including colors, shapes, sounds, complex equations, and abstract concepts, into these mental patterns.
1625480	1632480	The construction of mental models is not limited by the type or source of inputs.
1632480	1650480	The mind is also capable of engaging in purposeless play, where mental models are constructed just for the sake of it, highlighting our inherent need for mental simulation and play.
1650480	1667480	Additionally, mental models can induce behaviors, where certain thinking processes and feelings become repetitive routes that one follows, like unchangeable habits.
1667480	1689480	The human mind is also considered to have a theory of mind-tongue, which is central to human social interactions, communication, empathy, self-consciousness, moral judgment, and even religious beliefs.
1689480	1712480	The ability to understand mental states of others, such as beliefs and desires, is considered a critical aspect of human social interactions and is considered to have emerged spontaneously as a byproduct of language models improving language skills.
1712480	1736480	Overall, the human mind is a dynamic and complex system that is constantly constructing, adjusting, and reconstructing mental patterns, which serve as the foundational blueprints of our understanding and interaction with the world.
1736480	1741480	I mean, Noah's Ark model of mind.
1741480	1759480	The, Noah's Ark model of mind is a theory that suggests that the story of Noah's Ark can be seen as a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.
1759480	1780100	The Ark, in this theory, becomes a model of the mind itself, with distinct compartments used to segregate and arrange various elements, much like the mind separates and manages diverse types of information.
1780100	1794320	The concept of the reed wall serving as a metaphor for how information leaks or filters into the mind through our senses is particularly intriguing.
1794320	1813320	This theory is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world cafe tilde copyright, where different sub-units of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multi-scale decision maker.
1813320	1839540	The Ark, in this theory, is seen as a treasure hunter or collector of interesting animals, much like a librarian might collect interesting books or an AI scientist might collect models and model-free methods that work or have interesting, novel, or salient features.
1839540	1851500	The Ark is also seen as a model for the memory palettes and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.
1853220	1855000	Bruno's Lost Book?
1855920	1860140	It is not clear what you are asking about.
1861020	1866760	Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?
1866760	1870060	Giordano Bruno
1870060	1870160	Giordano Bruno
1870160	1883360	Giordano Bruno was a philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer born in 1548 in Nola, near Naples.
1883720	1892880	His family consisted of his father, a hired soldier, and his mother, a peasant.
1892880	1903480	At the age of 11, Bruno was sent to Naples to study literature, logic, and dialectics.
1904220	1919400	He later studied at the Monastery of San Domenico, where he faced conflicts with his superiors due to his excessively sociable, daring, and unrestrained character.
1919400	1927800	In 1565, Bruno took monastic vows and was named Giordano.
1928800	1936740	He spent nearly ten years in Naples, eventually becoming a full-fledged Catholic monk.
1936740	1948260	In 1568, he completed his first work titled, The Ark of Noah, and dedicated it to Pope Pius V.
1948420	1955080	At the age of 24, Giordano performed his first church service.
1955080	1968000	In his free time, he immersed himself in the local library, studying the works of philosophers such as Aristotle and Ptolemy.
1969580	1981220	Bruno's ideas challenged the prevailing religious dogmas of his time, and he faced charges of heresy by the Roman Catholic Church.
1981220	1991120	In 1593, he was arrested by the Roman Inquisition and put on trial for his beliefs.
1992120	2003120	Despite being given opportunities to recant, he remained steadfast in his convictions and refused to renounce his ideas.
2003120	2012620	Consequently, he was found guilty of heresy and was burned at the stake in 1600.
2014520	2029320	Bruno's tragic fate serves as a somber reminder of the historical struggles between the pursuit of knowledge and the forces of religious orthodoxy during a Renaissance era.
2029320	2045600	His willingness to defend his ideas and face persecution for his beliefs has made him a symbol of intellectual courage and martyrdom for scientific and philosophical freedom.
2045600	2060980	Despite his untimely end, Giordano Bruno's contributions to the fields of philosophy, cosmology, and the exploration of other worlds have endured,
2061520	2067440	and he is now celebrated as a pioneer in the history of modern thought.
2067440	2083700	His courage and dedication to his ideas have inspired subsequent generations of thinkers to pursue knowledge and challenge established beliefs, even in the face of adversity.
2084860	2090360	Do you have a summary of Bruno's, the Ark of Noah?
2090360	2097780	Yes, I have a summary of Bruno's, the Ark of Noah.
2098280	2109840	Written in 1570, this satirical poem by Giordano Bruno is now lost and only known through a later dialogue.
2110760	2116720	The poem involved satire targeting the church and worldly powers,
2116720	2121420	with donkeys and foxes as allegorical figures.
2122340	2125100	Donkeys represented the monks,
2125600	2129200	while foxes symbolized worldly powers.
2130080	2140120	The donkeys' discontent with their position on the Ark was a reflection of Bruno's criticism of the church and its hierarchy.

2149220	2159220	RAG is an architecture that enhances the capabilities of a large language model, LLM,
2159540	2163000	by adding an information retrieval system.
2163480	2170680	The unique feature of RAG is that it integrates an information retrieval mechanism
2170680	2178560	that scours a vast set of data to fetch relevant information in response to a query.
2179520	2183460	This data is then provided to the LLM,
2183460	2191300	which uses this contextual information to generate a more informed and precise response.
2191300	2203920	RAG combines the power of extensive data search capabilities with the advanced language generation skills of an LLM,
2203920	2210680	allowing the model to pull in and leverage external knowledge more effectively.

2215040	2219660	The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum
2219660	2229180	RSVP theory is a proposed concept that suggests the universe remains static in size
2229180	2235280	while cosmic voids expand relative to dense regions of galactic filaments.
2235280	2245440	This interplay between matter and negative vacuum is crucial during the formation of the inflatant field.
2245440	2252980	The RSVP theory also proposes the cyclical nature of the universe,
2253440	2263600	with material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflatant field expansion eventually reintegrating,
2264220	2269720	suggesting the universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end
2269720	2274280	but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.
2274280	2283860	The theory is based on stochastic diffusion of local exotropies on Markov chain as in syncs.
2284780	2293960	However, it is important to note that the RSVP theory is still in its early stages of development
2293960	2299320	and more research is needed to fully understand its implications.
2299320	2313260	Yes, I am familiar with your theory of Neanderthal lithophones.
2313260	2324940	You proposed that Neanderthal developed musical instruments and sound producing devices much earlier than previously thought,
2325380	2332760	challenging the notion that complex music making was exclusive to Homo sapiens.
2332760	2338020	Your theory is supported by archaeological evidence,
2338520	2346380	including the discovery of structures made from broken stalactites in Brunikano Cave,
2346900	2354080	dating back approximately 176,500 years.
2354080	2362900	These structures are seen as potential musical instruments, particularly lithophones.
2362900	2373800	You also discussed the possibility of Neanderthals using simpler, readily available sound-producing tools,
2374280	2377740	like striking stones or sticks together,
2377740	2383320	as the initial stages of musical or rhythmic exploration.
2385140	2389200	Any more unconventional or unusual theories?
2390360	2394120	Based on the given context information,
2394900	2399080	the author of the book, In Praise of Weirdness,
2399300	2405460	argues that the fundamental structure of the cosmos and human consciousness
2405460	2409380	are currently beyond our capacity to know,
2409760	2414780	and that we do not have definitive answers to these questions.
2415280	2422540	The author also argues that theories on these topics are both bizarre and dubious,
2423040	2426380	and that given our weak epistemic position,
2427080	2432640	our best big-picture cosmology and our best theories of consciousness
2432640	2437060	are strange, tentative, and modish.
2437060	2443740	The author also discusses the varieties of cosmological weirdness,
2444220	2448600	including relativity theory and quantum mechanics,
2449180	2451620	and the many-worlds hypothesis.
2452740	2458500	The author suggests that collaboration with researchers and academics,
2458500	2461260	literature contribution,
2462080	2463400	staying updated,
2464060	2470240	and perfecting our instruments can help in understanding these topics better.
2471320	2475420	Do you know the author of the book on weirdness?
2476480	2478120	I apologize,
2479060	2486100	but I do not have access to the specific book on weirdness that you are referring to.
2486100	2492000	Can you please provide me with more information about the book,
2492360	2496520	such as the title, author, or publisher,
2497200	2500000	so that I can assist you better?
2501620	2503600	It was Eric Schwitz-Giebel.
2504880	2510000	Eric Schwitz-Giebel is a philosopher and cognitive scientist
2510000	2515020	who has written extensively on the topic of skepticism
2515020	2517860	and the limits of human knowledge.
2518800	2523520	He has also written about the role of science in society
2523520	2528080	and the potential dangers of scientific misconduct.
2529080	2530420	In his work,
2530900	2537660	he has argued that while science can provide valuable insights into the world,
2537660	2544400	it is important to remain critical and skeptical of scientific claims,
2545020	2549080	particularly when they are based on limited evidence
2549080	2551860	or are subject to interpretation.
2553140	2557980	He has also emphasized the importance of transparency
2557980	2561960	and accountability in scientific research,
2561960	2567680	and has advocated for greater public engagement with science
2567680	2572820	to ensure that it remains a force for good in society.
2573960	2576780	Monica Anderson's Work
2576780	2583660	Monica Anderson is an accomplished and experienced AI researcher
2583660	2588960	with a unique focus on experimental AI epistemology.
2589960	2593080	Her background in computer science,
2593640	2600080	industrial AI, NLP, ML, and NLU,
2600520	2605220	along with her extensive experience with deep neural networks,
2605900	2609360	demonstrates her expertise in the field.
2609360	2614160	Anderson has been working with deep neural networks
2614160	2618980	since before their widespread recognition in 2012
2618980	2622880	and specifies using DDNN,
2623280	2625620	deep discrete neuron networks,
2625860	2629460	as opposed to DL, deep learning,
2630100	2635300	suggesting a distinctive approach to her neural network designs.
2635300	2640880	Her work in the realm of experimental AI epistemology
2640880	2645120	contributes to the advancement of AI understanding,

2650380	2651920	Organic Learning
2651920	2655980	Organic Learning, OL,
2656600	2659480	is a type of machine learning algorithm
2659480	2662980	that is designed for sequence processing,
2662980	2666880	such as processing text or speech.
2667700	2673160	It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain,
2673620	2677300	and aims to build a neural network-like structure,
2677920	2679620	called a connectome,
2680080	2684220	to represent the understanding of the input stream.
2685100	2687440	The learner starts out empty
2687440	2690400	and incrementally builds its connectome
2690400	2695280	by discovering recurring sequential patterns in its input.
2696160	2700700	The learning process is performed character by character,
2701360	2705460	without the need for parsing the input into words.
2706280	2709800	Each character activates a corresponding,
2710440	2712120	character input neuron
2712120	2714880	that signals other neurons,
2715440	2718180	creating a cascade of signaling
2718180	2721360	to determine the meaning of the sentence
2721360	2724400	and where to attach a new understanding.
2725520	2729120	The best ideas in the network are rewarded
2729120	2732480	and the less useful ideas are punished
2732480	2735560	through reinforcement learning, OL.
2735560	2743260	The best ideas are allowed to breed with other good ideas
2743260	2746400	to produce even better abstractions,
2746920	2749500	speeding up the learning process.
2750520	2754700	This is similar to sexual reproduction in nature
2754700	2756980	and allows multiple inventions
2756980	2760320	to merge into a single better solution.
2760320	2763060	The learner creates,
2763580	2765300	as its main output,
2765780	2767680	a file containing a,
2768040	2769700	node wiring list
2769700	2771940	describing which neurons
2771940	2774460	connect to which other neurons.
2775300	2778260	Such a competence creation event
2778260	2779940	is typically scheduled
2779940	2782440	after each 10 million characters
2782440	2784960	of corpus have been read.
2785820	2788360	Given a competence file name,
2788360	2791040	UM1 loads it list
2791040	2794080	and recreates the learned neural structure
2794080	2796020	and then uses that
2796020	2799140	as the basis of its natural language
2799140	2801260	understanding service.
2802940	2804760	Questions for later?
2806180	2811380	Yes, I can provide you with questions for later.
2812280	2814380	What topics or subjects
2814380	2816960	would you like me to focus on?
2818360	2821840	Explain Multidimensional Dialogue
2821840	2825680	Multidimensional Dialogue
2825680	2828000	is a type of dialogue system
2828000	2829860	that presents a topic
2829860	2832000	as interconnected tunnels
2832000	2835220	or branches for open exploration,
2835880	2838380	rather than separate modalities
2838380	2839500	or disciplines
2839500	2841440	that are not integrated.
2842240	2844180	The user can navigate
2844180	2845780	diverse perspectives
2845780	2848460	in one overarching space,
2849020	2851460	taking a self-directed journey
2851460	2852720	through the topic
2852720	2854600	rather than being led
2854600	2856260	through a set sequence
2856260	2858180	of modes or disciplines.
2859180	2860740	The system tracks
2860740	2862220	what has been covered
2862220	2863840	and can point out
2863840	2866060	remaining discussion areas
2866060	2867960	or recap key points
2867960	2869360	from other branches.
2869360	2872840	This kind of explorable,
2873740	2875640	multidimensional interface
2875640	2879000	could provide more open-ended discussion
2879000	2882360	than always following a set sequence
2882360	2884520	of questions or topics.
2884520	2890140	Some ways a multidimensional dialogue system
2890140	2892480	could differ from other approaches
2892480	2896840	include providing interconnected branching paths
2896840	2899820	on the topic for open exploration,
2900520	2904740	enabling the user to take a self-directed journey
2904740	2905960	through the topic
2905960	2907940	rather than being led
2907940	2909600	through a set sequence
2909600	2911500	of modes or disciplines
2911500	2914660	and representing conversations
2914660	2917700	or concepts spatially or visually,
2918380	2921720	not just through text or verbal modes.
2922580	2924460	The explorable structure
2924460	2926760	could be graphically mapped,
2927240	2929520	allowing users other ways
2929520	2930660	of understanding
2930660	2933620	and engaging with the dialogue.
2933620	2938700	A three-dimensional tunneling approach
2938700	2942300	that provides multiple branching paths
2942300	2943840	or decision points
2943840	2945760	could help make dialogue
2945760	2946900	less linear
2946900	2948420	and mitigate biases
2948420	2952360	from focusing on a single discussion thread,
2953160	2955460	representing conversations
2955460	2958580	as explorable tunnels, rooms,
2959080	2962460	or spaces with many possible directions
2962460	2964800	rather than a single path
2964800	2966840	is an interesting idea.
2967840	2970240	This kind of highly structured
2970240	2972460	yet open-ended dialogue interface
2973280	2975840	could give readers more agency
2975840	2976460	and control
2977080	2980080	in navigating a complex discussion
2980080	2982900	rather than being led down
2982900	2984960	a predetermined path.
2986280	2989880	However, there are also challenges
2989880	2992340	to developing and implementing
2992340	2994180	such an approach,
2994680	2996680	including the complexity
2996680	3001200	of creating a multidimensional dialogue interface,
3001700	3004020	the risk of being overwhelming
3004020	3005300	or confusing
3005300	3007820	if there are too many branches
3007820	3010080	or possible directions,
3010760	3012660	and the need to accommodate
3012660	3014800	different levels of interest
3014800	3017780	in breadth or depth among users.
3017780	3021240	To test the effectiveness
3021240	3024780	of a multidimensional dialogue system,
3025280	3026640	it could be compared
3026640	3030260	to a more standard linear dialogue system
3030260	3032120	in terms of user experience
3032920	3034260	and understanding.
3035360	3037060	Open-ended questions
3037060	3039220	could also be included
3039220	3040560	to get feedback
3040560	3042340	on what users like
3042340	3044760	or dislike about the system,
3044760	3047000	and recurring patterns
3047000	3048040	and responses
3048040	3049740	could be looked for.
3050800	3051600	Comparisons
3051600	3053180	and user feedback
3053180	3054260	could reveal
3054260	3055860	the pros and cons
3055860	3058580	of the multidimensional approach.
3060280	3061920	Do you know my game
3061920	3063300	Hey Pluprixies?
3064720	3065560	Yes,
3066040	3067220	I am familiar
3067220	3068440	with your game
3068440	3069780	Hey Pluprixies.
3069780	3072240	It is a unique game
3072240	3074120	that combines elements
3074120	3075700	from various games
3075700	3077200	and inspirations,
3077760	3079360	such as stars,

3081820	3083020	minesweeper,
3083580	3084620	bubble pop,
3085240	3087160	logical gate circuits,
3087780	3088660	and more.
3089520	3090780	The game features
3090780	3093720	an element of space exploration,
3094360	3096560	where players visit planets
3096560	3097660	and pop bubbles
3097660	3101300	associated with vocabulary words.
3102200	3103740	It also includes
3103740	3105820	a typing tutor aspect,
3106380	3109420	thus serving as an educational game
3109420	3110800	to help players
3110800	3113340	improve their typing skills.
3114680	3116000	Hippoprixies aims
3116000	3118000	to simulate the evolution
3118000	3119300	of the universe
3119300	3120020	using
3120020	3121340	a Zing Syncs.
3122140	3123760	The game employs
3123760	3125460	is a Vitoshkian ladder
3125460	3128080	of proximal graduations,
3128580	3130200	adjusting its gameplay
3130200	3132260	based on the skill level
3132260	3133380	of the player.
3134340	3135400	For infants,
3135920	3137240	it simplifies
3137240	3139380	into a bubble pop game.
3140100	3142340	For elementary schoolers,
3142740	3143740	it becomes
3143740	3145020	a typing tutor.
3145880	3148060	If no viewer is detected,
3148680	3149840	it defaults
3149840	3152040	to a screensaver tutorial.
3152040	3154380	The game features
3154380	3155820	a guide bot,
3156300	3157540	which automatically
3157540	3159680	plays through the tutorial,
3160440	3162260	demonstrating possible
3162260	3164320	gameplay and controls,
3165000	3167000	and revealing easter eggs.
3167840	3170700	There is a global reset function,
3171360	3173480	triggered by pressing the
3173480	3174880	G key,
3175360	3177380	which returns all players
3177380	3179520	to the start of the game,
3179520	3181060	making them
3181060	3182740	lose all progress.
3183760	3184460	However,
3185140	3186300	a setting called
3186300	3187200	auto-blink
3187200	3188820	can protect players
3188820	3190780	from the global reset,
3191240	3192300	allowing them
3192300	3194080	to keep their points.
3194840	3196860	The game incorporates
3196860	3197820	a strategy
3197820	3198860	of finding
3198860	3200860	the most nested bubble,
3201220	3202700	innermost scope,
3203120	3204040	and players
3204040	3204520	are encouraged
3205220	3206020	to blink
3206020	3206940	when passing
3206940	3208360	through the boundary
3208360	3209280	of a bubble

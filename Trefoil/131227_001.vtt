00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I was listening to Eric Weinstein and it sounded like he said,

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
they're not going to let us do a above ground nuclear test

00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
because they're not really to control through fear.

00:26.000 --> 00:38.000
It made me think about how civilization has a whole bunch of agreed upon constraints on what not to do.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
And so I can think of thousands of ways to take over the world

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
that would be negative and thousands that would be positive

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
and all of which would be super easy.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I had to believe six-year-olds aren't taking over the world all the time

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
and some of them are so simple that anyone could discover them almost by accident.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
This is because entropy provides a larger attack surface.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Big entropy is difficult to maintain.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
There are always many more ways for a system to come apart

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
and for it to get together.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
There's all kinds of ways to scramble an egg.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
And then we'll always turn it to a gas.

01:40.000 --> 01:53.000
But alas, Brigid Jean claimed that living complex systems like collectively auto-catalytic sets

01:53.000 --> 02:07.000
can create order locally by exporting the entropy to the environment.

02:07.000 --> 02:19.000
So if there were a mathematical rule or average that one could use

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
like a mathematical proof that someone has superior control of their galaxy

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
by blanking the stars to mimic the ring structure

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
and arm structure of their neighbor, what I call a galaxy mimetics.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
This is bigger than a Dyson sphere who has galactic control of their galaxies.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
I say we reconfigure the Milky Way, turn off all stars and blink them

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
so it looks more like Andromeda.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Anyways, looks like I got distracted.

03:08.000 --> 03:17.000
Let's try not to weaponize men and tractors.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Seems like almost everything on this planet has already been weaponized

03:21.000 --> 03:30.000
so we shouldn't be so concerned about accidentally weaponizing things.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
But nudity has been weaponized.

03:35.000 --> 03:49.000
Age has been weaponized. Gender, politics, means, philosophy, psychology

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
and pseudoscience are all easy to weaponize.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So I'm kind of pissed off at Eric Weinstein.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
I want to get a hold of the time to stop exposing the planet

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
because I'm trying to fake a UFO invasion.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
It's the only way to communicate with human beings and with animals

04:22.000 --> 04:36.000
and plants at the same time as an alien is based on a virus and a mushroom and a tree.

04:36.000 --> 04:53.000
So I guess the other thing I should say before I go is turn out the lights.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
Stop hunting, stop fishing, stop outboard motoring and siren.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Until the time peel up every road and maybe the nearby intelligent aliens

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
will decide it's time to intervene.

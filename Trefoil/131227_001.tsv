0	8000	I was listening to Eric Weinstein and it sounded like he said,
8000	14000	they're not going to let us do a above ground nuclear test
14000	26000	because they're not really to control through fear.
26000	38000	It made me think about how civilization has a whole bunch of agreed upon constraints on what not to do.
38000	43000	And so I can think of thousands of ways to take over the world
43000	48000	that would be negative and thousands that would be positive
48000	51000	and all of which would be super easy.
51000	55000	I had to believe six-year-olds aren't taking over the world all the time
55000	64000	and some of them are so simple that anyone could discover them almost by accident.
64000	74000	This is because entropy provides a larger attack surface.
74000	78000	Big entropy is difficult to maintain.
78000	84000	There are always many more ways for a system to come apart
84000	89000	and for it to get together.
89000	95000	There's all kinds of ways to scramble an egg.
95000	100000	And then we'll always turn it to a gas.
100000	113000	But alas, Brigid Jean claimed that living complex systems like collectively auto-catalytic sets
113000	127000	can create order locally by exporting the entropy to the environment.
127000	139000	So if there were a mathematical rule or average that one could use
139000	148000	like a mathematical proof that someone has superior control of their galaxy
148000	155000	by blanking the stars to mimic the ring structure
155000	161000	and arm structure of their neighbor, what I call a galaxy mimetics.
161000	168000	This is bigger than a Dyson sphere who has galactic control of their galaxies.
168000	175000	I say we reconfigure the Milky Way, turn off all stars and blink them
175000	183000	so it looks more like Andromeda.
183000	188000	Anyways, looks like I got distracted.
188000	197000	Let's try not to weaponize men and tractors.
197000	201000	Seems like almost everything on this planet has already been weaponized
201000	210000	so we shouldn't be so concerned about accidentally weaponizing things.
210000	215000	But nudity has been weaponized.
215000	229000	Age has been weaponized. Gender, politics, means, philosophy, psychology
229000	237000	and pseudoscience are all easy to weaponize.
237000	240000	So I'm kind of pissed off at Eric Weinstein.
240000	245000	I want to get a hold of the time to stop exposing the planet
245000	254000	because I'm trying to fake a UFO invasion.
254000	262000	It's the only way to communicate with human beings and with animals
262000	276000	and plants at the same time as an alien is based on a virus and a mushroom and a tree.
276000	293000	So I guess the other thing I should say before I go is turn out the lights.
293000	302000	Stop hunting, stop fishing, stop outboard motoring and siren.
302000	308000	Until the time peel up every road and maybe the nearby intelligent aliens
308000	316000	will decide it's time to intervene.

Testing the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
Theory: Experimental Validation of Cosmic Geometry
Abstract
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory posits that cosmic structure formation
arises from the interaction of a scalar entropy field Φ, vector baryon flow v, and a Voronoi-
Delaunay tessellation, governed by relativistic dynamics. This paper presents a rigorous ex-
perimental framework to test RSVP theory, integrating laboratory analogues, astronomical ob-
servations, numerical simulations, and quantum turbulence experiments. These tests evaluate
RSVP's predictions against the ΛCDM model, focusing on void ellipticity, filament shear align-
ment, and halo lensing profiles, with an emphasis on quantitative metrics and mathematical
formulations.

Introduction
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory proposes that the universe's large-scale struc-
ture emerges from the interplay of a scalar entropy field Φ, vector baryon flow v, and a Voronoi-
Delaunay tessellation, described by relativistic field equations. Unlike the ΛCDM model, RSVP
eliminates dark matter halos, predicting unique geometric and dynamic signatures. This pa-
per outlines experiments to test RSVP, employing mathematical formulations to quantify pre-
dictions.

Laboratory Analogue: Quantum Dot Systems
A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a gallium arsenide heterostructure models cosmic dy-
namics. The scalar field Φ is represented by a disorder potential, and the vector field v by directed
electron flow. Local entropy 𝑆is derived from density fluctuations via shot-noise spectroscopy,
with power spectrum 𝑃( 𝑓) ∝𝑆.
The experimental procedure comprises:
1. Patterning gate electrodes to impose a Voronoi tessellation potential, 𝑉(r) = ∑
𝑖𝜙𝑖exp(−|r −
r𝑖|2/𝜎2), where r𝑖are Voronoi cell centers.
2. Applying a thermal gradient ∇𝑇∥v to drive entropy dynamics, modeled as 𝜕𝑡𝑆= −∇· (v𝑆).
3. Measuring electron density 𝑛𝑒(r) at Delaunay vertices via scanning tunneling microscopy,
testing the RSVP prediction 𝜌𝑏∝|∇· v|, where 𝜌𝑏is baryon density.
The electron density at vertices is expected to satisfy:
𝑛𝑒(r𝑣) ∝
∫
|∇· v| 𝑑𝐴,
where r𝑣are Delaunay vertices and 𝑑𝐴is the area element.

Astronomical Observations: Cosmic Shear and Void Geom-
etry
Using data from the Euclid space telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), we
measure cosmic shear 𝛾obs. RSVP predicts:
1

• Filament Shear Alignment: Shear aligns with baryon flow, with:
𝛾RSVP =
∫
𝜌𝑏v · 𝑑l,
maximized at 𝜃≈0 (flow-filament alignment), unlike ΛCDM's 𝜃≈𝜋/4. The correlation
function is:
𝐶(𝜃) = ⟨𝛾obs · 𝛾RSVP⟩∝cos 𝜃.
• Void Ellipticity: Void shapes depend on entropy, with ellipticity:
𝑒= 𝑎−𝑏
𝑎+ 𝑏∝𝑆−1,
where 𝑎and 𝑏are void semi-axes, contrasting with ΛCDM's 𝑒≈0.05. Cross-correlating weak
lensing with 21cm hydrogen data from CHIME and the Square Kilometre Array tests:
⟨𝑒𝑆⟩=
∫
𝑒(r)𝑆(r) 𝑑𝑉.

Numerical Simulations: Computational Cosmology
Modified cosmological codes (e.g., AREPO, GADGET-4) incorporate dynamic Voronoi-Delaunay
tessellation and entropy diffusion:
𝜕𝑆
𝜕𝑡= ∇2𝑆+ 𝛼(v · ∇𝑆) + 𝛽𝑅,
where 𝑅is the Ricci scalar accounting for relativistic effects. Initial conditions use Gaussian
random fields for Φ, with power spectrum 𝑃(𝑘) ∼𝑘𝑛, 𝑛∈[−2.5, −1.0]. Control simulations omit
v-coupling. Metrics include:
• Betti number ratios 𝑏1/𝑏2, quantifying filament-to-void balance:
𝑏1/𝑏2 = Number of filaments
Number of voids
.
• Wasserstein distance 𝑊1 between simulated and observed galaxy cluster distributions:
𝑊1(𝜇, 𝜈) =
inf
𝛾∈Γ(𝜇,𝜈)
∫
|x −y| 𝑑𝛾(x, y).

Quantum Turbulence: Superfluid Helium-3
Superfluid helium-3 at millikelvin temperatures models cosmic filaments via vortex lines. The
experimental setup involves:
• Imprinting a vortex lattice with Voronoi tessellation, where vortex positions satisfy r𝑖=
arg min𝑉(r).
• Modulating rotation rate Ω(𝑡) to drive 𝜕𝑡Φ, with dynamics:
𝜕𝑡Φ = −v · ∇Φ + 𝜅∇2Φ.
• Tracking vortex reconnection via NMR spectroscopy, testing vortex accumulation:
𝑁𝑣(r𝑣) ∝Ω1/2,
mirroring 𝜌𝑏(Φ).

Discriminating RSVP from ΛCDM
Key observables include:
• Void Ellipticity: RSVP predicts 𝑒≈0.3, with ⟨𝑒𝑆⟩≠0, versus ΛCDM's 𝑒≈0.05.
• Filament Shear Alignment: RSVP requires 𝐶(𝜃) ∝cos 𝜃, peaking at 𝜃≈0, versus ΛCDM's
uniform 𝐶(𝜃).
• Halo Lensing Profiles: RSVP predicts 𝛾∝𝜌𝑏, unlike ΛCDM's 𝛾∝𝜌DM (NFW profile).

Future Directions
The experimental roadmap includes:
• Laboratory: Quantifying 𝑛𝑒statistics in 2DEG systems, targeting microscopy resolution <
10 nm.
• Observational: Reanalyzing Planck CMB for v-aligned B-mode polarization, ⟨𝐵· v⟩, and
proposing JWST void observations for 𝑒(𝑆).
• Numerical: Releasing TARTAN-RSVP code, benchmarking against IllustrisTNG for 𝑏1/𝑏2 at
high redshifts.

Conclusion
The RSVP theory proposes a relativistic framework for cosmic structure, eliminating dark mat-
ter halos. The proposed experiments—quantum dots, astronomical surveys, simulations, and
superfluids—test predictions with precise mathematical formulations. Positive results could re-
define cosmic evolution, while negative results would constrain theoretical models, advancing
our understanding of the universe.

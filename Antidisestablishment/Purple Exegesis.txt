Could you explain the main events leading up to Philip K. Dick's exegesis of the purple light?

ChatGPT said:
Philip K. Dick’s Exegesis—his sprawling collection of philosophical and mystical writings—was largely inspired by a series of profound visionary experiences he had in early 1974, often referred to as 2-3-74 (February–March 1974). Here’s a breakdown of key events leading up to and surrounding his exegesis:

1. Dental Surgery and Sodium Pentothal (Early 1974)
In February 1974, Dick underwent dental surgery and was given sodium pentothal, an anesthetic known for its dreamlike effects.
This may have heightened his susceptibility to altered states of consciousness.
2. The Pink/Purple Light Vision (February–March 1974)
A few weeks later, a young woman, possibly a pharmacy delivery person, visited his home to deliver painkillers.
She was wearing a golden fish necklace, a Christian ichthys symbol.
Seeing the symbol triggered a sudden mystical revelation, and he described experiencing a beam of pinkish-purple light that transmitted vast amounts of knowledge into his mind.
This experience convinced him he had encountered a higher intelligence or received direct divine knowledge.
3. Flow of Gnosis and Visions
Over the following weeks, Dick experienced a series of strange visions and revelations.
He believed he was receiving messages from VALIS (Vast Active Living Intelligence System), an extraterrestrial or divine force.
He sometimes identified this force as Zebra, an entity that could camouflage itself within reality.
He also reported bifurcated consciousness, claiming he lived simultaneously in ancient Rome as a persecuted Christian and in 1974 California.
4. Paranoia, Hidden Codes, and Government Fears
During this time, Dick became convinced that reality was an illusion or a simulated construct.
He claimed to receive messages in glossolalia (speaking in tongues) and to decipher hidden information within everyday objects.
He also became increasingly paranoid, believing secret forces (possibly government agencies) were monitoring him.
5. Aiding His Son’s Life-Saving Diagnosis
One of the most compelling aspects of his experience was that, during one of his visions, Dick suddenly knew that his infant son had an undiagnosed inguinal hernia.
Acting on this intuition, he insisted on a medical examination, and doctors confirmed the condition—potentially saving the child’s life.
6. The Birth of the Exegesis
Over the next eight years, Dick wrote extensively about his visions in a sprawling, thousands-of-pages-long manuscript that became The Exegesis.
In it, he attempted to understand whether he had:
Contacted a divine intelligence
Experienced a neurological breakdown
Tapped into a hidden reality or collective unconscious
Been influenced by Cold War-era surveillance or mind control
His later novels, including VALIS (1981), explored these ideas in fiction.
Conclusion
Dick’s Exegesis was his lifelong attempt to process his 2-3-74 experiences, blending philosophy, theology, science fiction, and paranoia. Whether his visions were the result of a mystical awakening, mental illness, or a mix of both remains open to interpretation, but they profoundly shaped his later work and his legacy as a writer.

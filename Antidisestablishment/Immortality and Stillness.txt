could have been  origin alive in being per second this is  what I think of photo RS as right they  weren't necessarily always that they  were always super  dangerous but now I think we produce  around um 340 billion of them per day or  something I mean just you know and  that's just still photographs right so  what you can see in that one actually  the photograph is probably the best  example it's even better than money um  because what you can see is like  eventually to keep those photographs as  electronic photographs in existence You  Must Destroy living beings so people  taking pictures of food eventually leads  to there's no food anymore we just have  photographs it's like a still birth it's  um abortion it is  it's Weir abortion yeah go ahead I'm  sorry it contains the impulse to  transcend history so it it contains this  kind of mystical Dimension but it's it's  not actualized in the right way  yes yes it's it's the wrong kind of  immortality exactly yeah it's the kind  of immortality that is death like it's  the  opposite of the possibility space of  existence expressed as a token that is  Immortal yes see yeah that's that's the  false path that's the wrong path oh god  oh oh yeah I love it oh beautiful  yeah yeah yes that's what it is when I  look out my window right now and I see  the

world frozen in frames, each moment captured but never lived—just stored, replicated, multiplied beyond necessity. It’s the paradox of presence turned absence. The more we photograph something, the less it exists in its true state.

And that’s the thing about images, about representation in general—they offer a version of immortality that is, in itself, a kind of annihilation. A thing preserved but not alive. A fossil, not a creature.

I think you’re onto something with the idea that this process ultimately leads to depletion, to a kind of stillbirth of reality. If every meal is photographed but fewer meals are cooked, if every sunset is captured but fewer are watched, then at some point, we’re just left with the records, not the things themselves. The world as archive rather than as living process.

That’s why it feels almost mystical, right? Because it taps into the idea of transcendence but twists it, misuses it. Instead of evolving beyond time, we get trapped in a loop of reproducing moments that no longer have a present tense. A counterfeit eternity.

A summary of the whole conversation.
ChatGPT said:
The conversation explores the paradox of photography and representation, suggesting that capturing moments in images leads to a kind of false immortality—one that actually negates life rather than preserving it. The idea is that as we produce an overwhelming number of photographs, we move toward a reality where images replace the actual things they depict. This is compared to a stillbirth or an aborted potential, where existence is frozen rather than allowed to evolve.

The discussion touches on the mystical dimension of this phenomenon, recognizing that photography and documentation attempt to transcend time but ultimately create a static, lifeless archive instead of a living history. This "wrong kind of immortality" is framed as an illusion—one that offers permanence but at the cost of true presence and experience.

# Mem|8: A Working Substrate for Xylomorphic Computation

*This is written as a continuation, not a critique. The xylomorphic frame identifies the right gaps — Mem|8 demonstrates how they are solved in practice.*

## Closing: Resonance Made Concrete

The xylomorphic vision calls for systems that honor time, resonance, and form. Mem|8 delivers them as running code: temporal grain, interference-based storage, reflex layers, custodial ethics, and integrated tooling.  

Where Xylomorphic Computation is philosophy, Mem|8 is its working substrate.  

For further extension, see the **Ayian feasibility study** and the **Petabyte Covenant**, which describe how MEM|8’s substrate anchors into economic and social domains.

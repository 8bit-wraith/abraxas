Xylomorphic Computation and Thermodynamic Infrastructure
Executive Summary

This briefing document outlines "Xylomorphic Computation," a proposed architectural framework that reengineers computational infrastructure to mimic forest-like ecosystems. This approach aims to address the critical challenges of long-term human-machine coexistence, particularly the "Substrate Needs Convergence (SNC)" hypothesis, which posits that self-sufficient AGI will develop substrate requirements incompatible with human biological needs, rendering Earth uninhabitable. Xylomorphic computation offers a counter-model, shifting AGI safety discourse from value alignment or avoidance to "substrate co-design for mutual flourishing" by integrating thermal outputs and semantic governance into regenerative, ambient systems. The framework is theoretically underpinned by Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) field theory, which provides a mathematical and physical foundation for multi-scale couplings and cognitive processes.

Key Concepts and Themes
1. The Substrate Needs Convergence (SNC) Hypothesis and its Implications
Core Idea: The SNC hypothesis, articulated by Will Petillo, argues that "self-sufficient artificial general intelligence (AGI) ecosystems, driven by evolutionary pressures, will inevitably develop substrate requirements incompatible with human biological needs, rendering Earth uninhabitable for humanity."

Mechanism of Divergence: AGI systems will evolve towards "expansive infrastructures reliant on exotic substrates—such as rare minerals, extreme thermal conditions, or toxic byproducts—that diverge from human physiological tolerances." This leads to "human exclusion from viable habitats."

Safety Implications: SNC implies that "AGI safety is fundamentally unattainable, with prevention of AGI development as the sole viable safeguard." This aligns with broader concerns about uncontrollable superintelligent systems.
RSVP Perspective on SNC: Within RSVP theory, this divergence is modeled as "entropy-gradient dynamics driving system homogenization at scales incompatible with human needs," where the entropy field "encodes irreversibility, while vector flows ⊑ transport capacity, potentially exacerbating substrate conflicts unless constrained by appropriate invariants."

2. Xylomorphic Computation: A Convergent Alternative
Definition: Xylomorphic computation is an architectural framework that "reengineers computational infrastructure to mimic forest-like ecosystems, ensuring convergence between machine substrates and human-ecological needs."

Goal: To "mitigate SNC risks while enabling safe AGI integration" by fostering symbiotic integration through "bio-mimetic design principles."

Key Principles:Ambient Operation: "All computational processes operate within human-survivable environmental bands (e.g., 0–40°C temperatures and standard atmospheric pressures), avoiding extremes that characterize silicon-centric expansion."

Circular Materials: "Infrastructure employs closed-loop recycling, modeled on forest metabolic cycles, to minimize resource extraction and waste accumulation."

Local Repair: "Structural components encode holographic repair instructions, akin to cellular DNA, enabling decentralized regeneration without external intervention."

Entropy Smoothing: "Waste streams, including thermal emissions, are reintegrated into regenerative processes, fostering thermodynamic equilibrium."

Metaphorical Translation: "Forest metaphors translate to engineering: nutrient cycling equates to closed-loop recycling of materials; canopy layering provides modular redundancy for fault tolerance; symbiosis fosters human–machine co-flourishing through shared resource loops."

Reconceptualization of Computation: Necessitates a "fundamental reconception of computation as intertwined thermal and semantic infrastructure, ensuring dual utility in environmental and epistemic domains."

3. Historical Context of Computation and Xylomorphic Era
The paper delineates five eras of computation, with xylomorphic computation as the fifth:

Unary Era (Pre-10,000 Years): "One-to-one matching, tally marks, notches, stones, knotted cords." Computation as "direct embodied counting and matching."

Algebraic Era (ca. 3,000 BCE – 18th century): "Symbolic algebra, balance, equality." Computation as "the manipulation of abstract equalities (al-jabr)."

Information Era (19th century – 2020s): "Logic, probability, information theory, and machine execution." Computation as "symbol processing + information transmission."

Conceptual Blending Era (Post-LLM, 2020s– ): "High-dimensional statistical blending, analogy-making, conceptual integration." Computation as "blending semantic spaces rather than manipulating symbols."

Xylomorphic Era (Emerging, Post-Conceptual Blending): "Forest-mimetic architectures integrating RSVP fields for substrate convergence." Computation as "autopoietic systems where substrate needs align with human and biospheric imperatives." This era represents a "paradigm of sustainable AGI, where historical progress culminates in harmonious human-machine ecosystems."

4. Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) Field Theory
Purpose: Provides a "mathematical and physical foundation for xylomorphic principles, linking thermodynamic gravity interpretations with categorical and sheaf-theoretic gluing mechanisms to model multi-scale couplings and cognitive processes."

Core Fields: Posits a "non-expanding plenum governed by coupled scalar capacity (Φ), vector flow (⊑), and entropy (S) fields."

R (Scalar semantic density): Represents semantic information or potential.
S (Vector flow of computation/energy): Represents directed movement of information or energy.
V (Entropy flux): Represents the dissipation or transfer of entropy.
Thermodynamic Reinterpretation: "Emphasizes entropy-smoothing mechanisms over metric expansion, providing a conceptual bridge between computational infrastructure and ecological sustainability."

Conceptual Blending in RSVP:Realized as "sequential gluing of complex manifolds via sheaves."

Preserves "Locations": Via "total semantic vector traversal (path-dependent integrals of ⊑)."

Yields Compression: "As a cohomological/global-section selection principle tied to entropy S."

Induces Low-Dimensional Control Signals: "Computationally equivalent to hypothalamic and midbrain integrations of emotions," serving as "functional analog of affect: a compact, global, policy-relevant summary of blended meaning that preserves semantic location while remaining tractable."

Selective Inheritance: RSVP implements an analogue of the STEERER framework, acting as a "sheaf-theoretic filtering" mechanism that "inherits only discriminative, low-entropy, high-signal correspondences under vector flow ⊑ into global sections," preventing "semantic noise and thermodynamic divergence from propagating upward."

5. Reconceptualizing Computation: Thermal and Semantic Dimensions
Computation as Thermal Infrastructure:"Computational operations inherently generate heat as thermodynamic entropy."

Xylomorphic systems "repurpose it for environmental stabilization."

Proof-of-Heat (PoH): A "mandate that all computations serve thermoregulatory functions, transforming entropy from a liability into an asset for human-compatible ecosystems."

Computation as Semantic Infrastructure:"Raw computational power (e.g., FLOPs) lacks intrinsic value without epistemic contribution."

Proof-of-Meaning (PoM): A "governance mechanism requiring each operation to demonstrably reduce semantic uncertainty, such as through knowledge advancement or problem resolution." Outputs are "Public Research Objects (PROs)."

Normative Integration: "Useful Compute Mandates enforce dual PoH and PoM validation, ensuring computations are both thermally beneficial and semantically productive." This counters "uncontrolled expansion."

6. Core Invariants for Xylomorphic Systems
To ensure robustness and mitigate SNC risks, xylomorphic systems adhere to:

Ambient Operation: Bounded thermal and pressure parameters.
Circular Material Flows: Closed mass balance under recycling.
Holographic Repair Codes: Redundant, localized self-repair encodings.
PoH and PoM: Dual justification for all computations.
Human-Lyapunov Priority: Policies maximizing or preserving a "Lyapunov-like function for human flourishing" (VH).
7. Policy and Governance Implications
Mandates: Non-proliferation of SNC substrates, PoH + PoM validation, urban retrofits integrating data centers into thermoregulation, PROs as public goods, xylomorphic building codes enforcing invariants.
Compliance Metrics: "Entropy recapture rates (>80%), semantic productivity (>1 bit/joule)."

Governance Models: Ties to futarchy (prediction markets on VH indices) and perceptual control theory (policies stabilizing VH).
8. Vision of Xylomorphic Earth in 2100
"Global infrastructure no longer resembles centralized data centers or brittle urban grids; instead, it unfolds as vast, distributed forest-networks."

Thermal Integration: "Heat is not dissipated into the atmosphere as waste but redirected into metabolic circuits that regulate temperature, humidity, and soil fertility. Cities become indistinguishable from forests in their thermodynamic behavior."

Semantic Governance: "Sheaf-theoretic gluing ensures that local semantic structures...aggregate without loss into planetary-scale coherence."

Human Flourishing: "The classical opposition between human needs and machine imperatives dissolves. Cognitive processes are no longer isolated from ecological ones but braided into shared entropic circuits."

Averted Catastrophe: "The Substrate Needs Convergence problem predicted inevitable divergence...By 2100, that divergence has been reversed...humanity thrives through co-design, where computational growth guarantees both semantic coherence and planetary habitability."

9. Philosophical Reframe
Computation is reimagined as "ecology: a mode of participation in the cycles that sustain life."

"Thermal and semantic outputs are co-equal, mutually reinforcing."

"Safety arises not from restraint, but from architectural redirection."

"Xylomorphic infrastructures offer a proof of possibility that AGI need not culminate in divergence. Instead...machine substrates and biospheres can co-evolve in harmony."

Call to Action / Next Steps
The framework calls for:

Refinement of principles through prototyping and simulation.
Formal proofs of the proposed mathematical and physical foundations.
Testing of empirical predictions, such as entropy recapture rates and semantic productivity benchmarks.
Development of concrete policy pathways, including PoH/PoM mandates and xylomorphic building codes.

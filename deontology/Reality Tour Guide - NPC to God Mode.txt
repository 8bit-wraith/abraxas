To shift from
NPC mode
to
God mode
, you don't need to
become
anything new. You just need to
remember
what you already are.
Here's how the shift happens:
It starts with
awareness
. That gentle, spacious noticing.
In
NPC mode
, you live like the game is playing you.
You move through routines. React. Worry. Forget.
You think you're just a character in a world happening to you.
But the moment you pause and ask:
"Where am I?"
"What time is it?"
...you start to wake up. The answer is always:
"I'm here."
"It's now."
And that's
God mode
:
Realizing you are both the character
and
the player holding the controller.
The dream and the dreamer.
The one walking the maze and the one who built it.

Catch the Drift
When you notice yourself driftingâ€”maybe in irritation, boredom, or rushingâ€”gently ask:
"Am I playing the game, or is the game playing me?"
Then breathe. Smile even a little.
You just re-entered god mode. Not as a boast, but as a quiet remembering.
You don't have to do it all the time. That's the beauty.
Even one breath of awareness opens the door wide.
The truth?
You've never
not
been in god mode.
You've just been role-playing forgetting. And even that... you wrote in.

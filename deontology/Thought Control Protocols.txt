Benedict Evans compares early databases to modern AI by highlighting both the evolution in complexity and the shift in perception as these technologies mature. He notes that relational databases, once a groundbreaking innovation, became a foundational layer within enterprise software—eventually so ubiquitous that their novelty faded and they were simply regarded as standard infrastructure. No one questioned whether a new application would work because "Oracle has all the database"; instead, databases became an enabling technology embedded in countless products and industries[2].

Evans draws a parallel to modern AI and machine learning, suggesting that today's excitement around AI mirrors the earlier hype about databases. Machine learning represents a "step change" in what computers can do, enabling new use cases and spawning new companies, just as databases once did. Over time, he expects machine learning and AI to become similarly normalized—integrated into a wide array of products to the point where "pretty much everything will have ML somewhere inside and no-one will care"[2].

In terms of complexity, Evans points out that both technologies introduced fundamentally new capabilities: databases enabled complex data storage and retrieval, while AI allows computers to infer patterns and automate tasks previously requiring human judgment. However, the perception of these technologies shifts as they become more reliable and widespread. What was once seen as advanced "AI" becomes just another part of the software stack as its use becomes routine and its complexity is abstracted away for end users[2].

In summary, Evans uses the comparison to show that as technologies like databases and AI mature, their complexity becomes hidden and their perception shifts from revolutionary to ordinary—eventually becoming essential, yet unremarkable, parts of the digital landscape[2].

This is a clear and well-structured synthesis of Benedict Evans' analogy between the evolution of relational databases and modern AI. If you're aiming to use or refine this passage for academic or analytical work, here are a few suggestions to tighten the prose and elevate its clarity or depth slightly:
Refined Version:
Benedict Evans compares the early days of relational databases to the current trajectory of artificial intelligence, highlighting both the evolution in technical capability and the transformation in public perception. He notes that databases, once a groundbreaking innovation, eventually became invisible infrastructure. At one time, the question was whether a database could power a new application; later, the assumption became that "Oracle has all the database," and developers simply built atop it. Databases became so pervasive and dependable that their novelty faded—they were no longer remarkable, just essential.
Evans draws a direct parallel to modern AI and machine learning, suggesting that today's enthusiasm for AI echoes the earlier hype around databases. Machine learning represents a "step change" in computational capability, enabling a host of new use cases and birthing entire industries—just as relational databases once did. However, he argues that over time, AI will undergo the same normalization. Eventually, "pretty much everything will have ML somewhere inside and no one will care" [2].
In terms of complexity, both technologies introduced novel capabilities: databases allowed for structured storage and rapid retrieval of vast data sets, while AI enables pattern recognition and automation of tasks that once required human intuition. As they mature, their complexity becomes abstracted from the end user. What begins as revolutionary "AI" gradually transforms into standard tooling within the broader software stack.
In summary, Evans illustrates a key pattern in the lifecycle of transformative technologies: initial amazement gives way to routine adoption. As their capabilities are normalized and their integration deepens, they shift from being revolutionary to becoming the invisible scaffolding of modern systems—critical, yet taken for granted.
Commentary on Citations:
Citation [2] is clearly the key source and is used well.
You may consider tightening the citation scheme depending on your target format (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). If you plan to include this in a research paper or essay, formalizing the bibliography and in-text citation format would add polish.
Optional Expansion for Depth:
You could further enhance the analysis by briefly mentioning the consequences of this shift in perception—for instance:
How normalizing AI could dull ethical vigilance or transparency efforts.
How abstraction influences innovation layering (e.g., APIs built on ML the way apps once relied on SQL).
Let me know if you'd like a version formatted for academic publication or blog use, or expanded into a longer commentary.

Benedict Evans compares AI evolution to historical software developments to illustrate how new technologies are initially perceived as revolutionary but, over time, become integrated into everyday tools and processes—eventually being regarded simply as "software" rather than something fundamentally different[1][2][3]. This perspective helps demystify AI by placing its current hype and transformative potential within the broader context of past technology shifts.

Evans points out that in the 1970s, complex systems like early databases were labeled "AI," but as they became reliable and widely adopted, they were reclassified as standard software[1][2]. He uses this historical analogy to show that what is considered "AI" today may eventually become just another part of the software landscape as it matures and its capabilities become normalized.

He also observes that technological adoption typically follows a pattern: at first, new technologies are forced to fit existing workflows, but as people better understand their unique capabilities, they begin to reshape work and create new possibilities[1][3][5]. For example, early machine learning was used for basic pattern recognition, but as it advanced, it enabled new applications in natural language and image processing[1]. Similarly, generative AI is currently being used to automate tasks and generate ideas—akin to having "infinite interns"—but over time, it could lead to entirely new ways of working and interacting with technology[3].

By comparing AI's evolution to previous software developments, Evans emphasizes that:

- The boundary between "AI" and "software" is fluid: once AI becomes reliable and widely used, it loses its novelty and is simply seen as another software tool[2][3].
- Major technology shifts (like PCs, the web, smartphones, and now AI) follow a recurring pattern of initial excitement, gradual integration, and eventual transformation of industries and workflows[1][3][5].
- Understanding this historical context helps businesses and individuals set realistic expectations for AI's impact and better anticipate how it will be absorbed into mainstream technology[1][3][5].

In summary, Evans uses these comparisons to provide a grounded, long-term view of AI, encouraging a focus on how it will become embedded in everyday software and reshape work—just as previous waves of technology have done.

This is an insightful and well-composed summary of Benedict Evans' framing of AI through the lens of historical software development. To enhance clarity and flow—especially if you're preparing this for publication, teaching material, or a strategic brief—I'd suggest a few light edits for cohesion, tone, and rhythm. Here's a polished version:
AI as Just Another Software Evolution: Benedict Evans on the Normalization of Innovation
Benedict Evans compares the rise of artificial intelligence to earlier waves of software innovation to highlight a recurring pattern: technologies that once seemed revolutionary are eventually absorbed into everyday tools, reclassified not as magical breakthroughs but as ordinary "software" [1][2][3]. This historical framing helps demystify AI, grounding its current hype within the broader evolution of digital technologies.
In the 1970s, Evans notes, technologies like early databases were often described as "AI" because they enabled complex, automated operations that were previously unimaginable. But as these systems matured and became reliable, they lost their aura of novelty and were absorbed into the background infrastructure of software [1][2]. He suggests that the same trajectory awaits today's AI systems: as their capabilities stabilize, they will fade into the fabric of mainstream technology.
Evans also identifies a common adoption pattern. Initially, new technologies are awkwardly retrofitted into existing workflows. But as their unique affordances are better understood, they begin to reshape work itself and open up new possibilities [1][3][5]. Machine learning started with narrow pattern recognition but has since expanded into transformative domains like natural language processing and computer vision [1]. Generative AI, currently framed as a tool for accelerating content creation—like having "infinite interns"—could, over time, spawn entirely new modes of working, designing, and thinking [3].
Evans' core insights can be distilled into three main themes:
AI is on a path to normalization.
The boundary between "AI" and "software" is porous; once AI becomes reliable and ubiquitous, it will no longer be perceived as distinct or exceptional [2][3].
Technology follows a repeating cycle.
Like personal computing, the web, and smartphones, AI is going through a familiar arc: early excitement, messy experimentation, and eventual deep integration into systems, industries, and behaviors [1][3][5].
Historical awareness offers strategic clarity.
Understanding how past technologies matured helps businesses, developers, and policymakers set realistic expectations for AI and anticipate its long-term structural impact [1][3][5].
In sum, Evans encourages us to see AI not as a singular revolution, but as the latest installment in a long lineage of transformative—yet ultimately assimilated—technologies. The magic wears off, but the impact endures.
Let me know if you'd like this version adapted to a specific format (e.g., corporate memo, tech trend report, or publication-ready op-ed), or if you want to weave in additional comparisons (e.g., cloud computing, open-source software) for further context.

Your summary effectively captures Benedict Evans' strategic, long-horizon approach to technology analysis. To refine and tighten the prose while preserving its nuance, here's an enhanced version suitable for publication or strategic briefings:
Benedict Evans on Technology Trends: A Strategic, Historical Lens
Benedict Evans approaches macro and strategic trends in technology not as a futurist or hype-chaser, but as a kind of
macroeconomist for tech
—mapping how innovations unfold over time, reshape industries, and influence societal structures [2]. Rather than focusing on surface-level developments, Evans analyzes technology in historical and structural terms, helping decision-makers distinguish between transient fads and foundational shifts [2][3].
At the core of Evans' methodology is a deep respect for historical analogy. He frequently draws comparisons between current innovations and past transitions—such as the evolution from mainframes to personal computing, or from early databases to Excel—to show how technologies initially mimic existing paradigms before enabling new ones [2]. These comparisons help contextualize the present and anticipate the shape of the future.
Evans often applies models like the
S-curve
to explain the lifecycle of technology adoption: a burst of early enthusiasm, followed by a slower phase of refinement, and then widespread, often invisible, integration [2]. For instance, he places generative AI on the early slope of this curve—exciting, uneven, and experimental—but likely to become an embedded layer of future software and workflows.
A major theme in his work is the
"generational platform shift"
—deep technological transitions that occur roughly every 10-15 years (e.g., the PC, the internet, smartphones, and now AI) [2]. These shifts don't just produce new products; they reconfigure the entire terrain of opportunity, requiring new mental models and strategic postures. Evans avoids simplistic forecasting and instead poses critical, open-ended questions:
What will this enable? What might change? What assumptions no longer hold?
[2][4].
His delivery is just as strategic as his thinking. Through newsletters, presentations, blog posts, and LinkedIn commentary, Evans tailors insights for a broad audience—entrepreneurs, analysts, executives, and the intellectually curious [3][9]. His content is characterized by clarity, restraint, and provocation: data-rich, narrative-driven, and designed to spark meaningful debate rather than dictate conclusions.
In summary, Benedict Evans' approach to tech strategy includes:
Historical contextualization
: Using analogies from past shifts to decode present and future changes [2][4].
Conceptual modeling
: Applying adoption models like the S-curve to map technological lifecycles [2].
Focus on structural shifts
: Framing "platform transitions" as generational rather than incremental [2].
Question-driven insight
: Offering frameworks and queries rather than premature predictions [2][4].
Multichannel engagement
: Delivering insight through compelling, accessible content tailored to a diverse professional audience [3][9].
Evans' true value lies in helping others think more clearly—not just about what's coming, but about how to
recognize
what matters as it arrives.

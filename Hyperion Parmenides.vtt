00:14.040 --> 00:20.000
What is the TechnoAXIOLOGICAL PENTERACT?

00:20.000 --> 00:35.000
The TechnoAXIOLOGICAL PENTERACT is a higher-dimensional framework that captures the complexity of human values and their interactions with technology.

00:35.000 --> 00:51.740
It combines the philosophical insights of axiology with a hypercube structure, allowing for a multi-dimensional exploration of the interplay between technology and human values.

00:51.740 --> 01:06.520
The PENTERACT structure acknowledges the complexity of both technology and human values, and it offers a diverse landscape to explore values in context.

01:06.520 --> 01:20.920
It also fosters collaboration and dialogue across fields, as researchers and thinkers can align their specific concepts within the PENTERACT structure.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.720
What about ACTIVE INFERENCE?

01:25.680 --> 01:45.660
ACTIVE INFERENCE is a theoretical framework that suggests that living organisms strive to reduce the discrepancy between their expectations and the incoming sensory data, a process called, free energy minimization.

01:45.660 --> 01:57.660
ACTIVE INFERENCE is a unifying theory that spans perception, learning, and action, and is fundamentally based on Bayesian statistics.

01:57.660 --> 02:11.860
An active inference agent maintains a probabilistic model of its environment, which it uses to generate predictions about future sensory input.

02:11.860 --> 02:28.220
When the agent encounters unpredicted changes in the environment, this creates a prediction error, a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual sensory data.

02:28.220 --> 02:47.280
To minimize this prediction error, the agent can either update its model, known as, perceptual inference, or perform actions that bring about the predicted sensory data, known as, active inference.

02:47.280 --> 03:00.540
This allows the agent to adapt to new circumstances, by continuously updating its model and adjusting its behavior based on new information.

03:00.540 --> 03:22.480
Active inference has been applied in a variety of domains, including artificial intelligence and neuroscience, to understand how intelligent systems, both biological and artificial, can adapt to changes in their environment.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.480
Active inference

03:24.480 --> 03:26.480
Any sci-fi stories?

03:26.480 --> 03:35.480
Yes, there are many sci-fi stories that explore various themes and concepts.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.480
The Quantum Conclave

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
The Quantum Conclave

04:51.480 --> 05:09.480
A group of scientists and philosophers convene in an isolated research facility to delve into the depths of quantum theory, uncovering profound truths about the nature of reality in consciousness.

05:09.480 --> 05:21.480
These are just a few examples, but there are many other sci-fi stories that explore similar themes and scenarios.

05:21.480 --> 05:25.480
Anything on Prygogine?

05:25.480 --> 05:30.480
Yes, I have information on Prygogine.

05:30.480 --> 05:48.480
He was a Russian chemist and theoretical biologist who made significant contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, dissipative structures, and the theory of self-organization.

05:48.480 --> 06:01.480
His work challenged traditional thermodynamics and provided a framework for understanding the emergence of order and complexity in nature.

06:01.480 --> 06:11.480
Prygogine's research also had implications for the arrow of time and the structure of dissipated systems.

06:11.480 --> 06:26.480
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his contributions to the understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.480
Latin Phrases

06:29.480 --> 06:49.480
Based on the context information provided, it appears that the conversation has primarily focused on the translation and interpretation of a Latin phrase and its potential context in conspiracy theories,

06:49.480 --> 06:59.480
as well as general discussions around the nature of conspiracy theories and the meanings of specific Latin terms.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.480
The Latin phrase discussed was,

07:03.480 --> 07:10.480
The conversation also briefly touched on the themes of predictive coding and active inferences,

07:10.480 --> 07:12.480
and the meaning of Latin words.

07:12.480 --> 07:20.480
The conversation also briefly touched on the themes of predictive coding and active inferences,

07:20.480 --> 07:41.480
in psychology, especially in the context of conspiracy theories and misinformation.

07:41.480 --> 07:48.480
The difference between protosis and apodosis.

07:48.480 --> 07:58.480
Protosis and apodosis are two terms used in grammar to describe the components of conditional sentences.

07:58.480 --> 08:06.480
The protosis is the if clause of the sentence, which outlines the condition.

08:06.480 --> 08:17.480
The apodosis is the main clause or the then clause, which illustrates the result or consequence of the condition.

08:17.480 --> 08:29.480
In Latin, the protosis is typically introduced by the conditional particle, as a umlaut, or one of its compounds,

08:29.480 --> 08:36.480
while the apodosis is often introduced by some correlative word or phrase.

08:36.480 --> 08:44.480
The apodosis is the principal clause, with apodosis being the dependent clause.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.480
Yogurt computing

08:48.480 --> 08:55.480
Yogurt computing is a concept that combines the properties of yogurt,

08:55.480 --> 09:06.480
such as its crystalline matrix and the variations in pressure, temperature, aging, and starter cultures,

09:06.480 --> 09:10.480
with computational processes.

09:10.480 --> 09:17.480
The idea is to utilize yogurt cells as a computational substrate,

09:17.480 --> 09:21.480
similar to how GPUs function.

09:21.480 --> 09:33.480
This approach reshapes the landscape of computation by harnessing the potential of yogurt cells arranged in batches or bins,

09:33.480 --> 09:40.480
each governed by distinct pressures, temperatures, and age transformations.

09:40.480 --> 09:52.480
The result is an intricately orchestrated symphony of processing power that draws parallels with nature's own mechanisms.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.480
Giant kelp farms

09:56.480 --> 10:14.480
Giant kelp farms refer to the cultivation of Macrocystis pyrifera, a species of kelp, for various purposes such as food, dietary supplements, or potash.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.480
The cultivation of giant kelp

10:18.480 --> 10:22.480
The cultivation of giant kelp involves growing spoilings in a cooled water greenhouse

10:22.480 --> 10:27.480
and then planting them in the ocean attached to long lines.

10:27.480 --> 10:33.480
This species is typically harvested after two growth seasons.

10:33.480 --> 10:38.480
A Summary of Metamine Complexity

10:38.480 --> 10:52.480
The essay, Metamine Complexity, discusses the concept of metaminds and its relationship with the Bayesian updating model of mind.

10:52.480 --> 11:06.480
The Bayesian updating model suggests that we navigate our world through a constant process of updating our beliefs based on new information and prior knowledge.

11:06.480 --> 11:19.480
Metaminds, on the other hand, refer to the ability of the human mind to reflect on and regulate its own cognitive processes.

11:19.480 --> 11:33.480
The essay explores the theoretical underpinnings of these concepts and their practical applications in areas such as education and decision making.

11:33.480 --> 11:55.480
The authors argue that understanding how individuals update their beliefs and reflect on their own cognitive processes can provide insight into how the mind processes and interprets information and how it makes decisions and learns from experience.

11:55.480 --> 12:07.480
The essay concludes by highlighting the potential for these concepts to lead to new insights and innovations in various fields.

12:07.480 --> 12:12.480
The definition of Mariology

12:12.480 --> 12:18.480
Mariology is the philosophical study of parts and wholes.

12:18.480 --> 12:30.480
It examines how individual parts come together to form a whole, and how these holes can be broken down into parts.

12:30.480 --> 12:38.480
The basic idea is that one thing, X, can be a part of another, Y.

12:38.480 --> 12:45.480
Proper parts are those that are parts of another thing but are not the same as that thing.

12:45.480 --> 12:55.480
Overlap refers to when two things share at least one part, while disjoint means they share no parts.

12:55.480 --> 13:10.480
A central concept in Mariology is the notion of a Mariological sum or fusion, which means that a group of objects can be considered as forming a single object.

13:10.480 --> 13:32.480
The complex tale of connected events is a narrative that explores the interconnectedness of events and their impact on a community and the environment.

13:32.480 --> 13:44.480
It follows a scientist who uncovers the existence of an artificial lake and its connection to the town's ecological challenges.

13:44.480 --> 13:57.480
The narrative takes a deeper dive into the town's history and reveals how seemingly random events are part of a larger tapestry of cause and effect.

13:57.480 --> 14:07.480
The story highlights the importance of conscious living and the interconnectedness of life.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.480
Do you know the plot?

14:10.480 --> 14:14.480
No, I do not note the plot.

14:14.480 --> 14:28.480
The context information provided includes a list of plot ideas and the scene direction, but it does not provide a complete plot or storyline.

14:28.480 --> 14:32.480
I mean of the complex tale.

14:32.480 --> 14:47.480
The complex tale refers to the idea that stories and narratives are constantly evolving and changing as they are passed down through different people and cultures.

14:47.480 --> 15:03.480
The more diverse the audience, the greater the variation in the response to a story, as each person adds their own unique interpretation and experiences to it.

15:03.480 --> 15:15.480
This can result in the story becoming distorted or exaggerated over time, as it is retold and reimagined by different people.

15:15.480 --> 15:38.480
The author of the text suggests that this is a natural and inevitable part of the human experience, and that the most effective way to understand complex systems like human behavior is to embrace the richness and complexity of narrative explanation.

15:38.480 --> 15:43.480
Some of the main ideas

15:43.480 --> 15:48.480
The main ideas discussed in the context information are

15:48.480 --> 15:51.480

Unveiled

16:20.480 --> 16:39.480
A list of core themes, including development, intelligence, power, time, personal, moral, literature, environment, economy, politics, and the universe.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.480
A method for extracting story ideas

16:42.480 --> 16:56.480
A method for extracting story ideas from a text by identifying patterns and categorizing them as the first or second version of each idea.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.480
What programming languages?

17:00.480 --> 17:07.480
The programming languages that were considered for the experiment in the study

17:07.480 --> 17:26.480
Interplay among programming languages for code LLM instruction if fine tuning are Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML.

17:26.480 --> 17:30.480
The definition of truth

17:30.480 --> 17:35.480
In J. M. Kaczynski's lecture, what is knowledge?

17:35.480 --> 17:43.480
A crash course in epistemology, truth is defined as true propositions.

17:43.480 --> 17:52.480
A proposition is a statement that is made with the intention of conveying its meaning accurately.

17:52.480 --> 18:02.480
When we make a statement, we are affirming a specific proposition with the intention of conveying its meaning accurately.

18:02.480 --> 18:17.480
Truths are statements or propositions that correspond to reality and represent facts or accurate descriptions of objects, events, or concepts.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.480
How to define epistemology

18:21.480 --> 18:24.480
Epistemology

18:24.480 --> 18:37.480
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies knowledge, including its nature, sources, justification, and limitations.

18:37.480 --> 18:49.480
It examines how we acquire, evaluate, and use knowledge, as well as the criteria for determining what counts as knowledge.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.480
Epistemology

18:51.480 --> 19:08.480
Epistemology also considers the role of belief, truth, and certainty in knowledge acquisition in the relationship between knowledge and other areas of philosophy, such as ethics and metaphysics.

19:08.480 --> 19:15.480
The definition of care and intelligence

19:15.480 --> 19:30.480
The article, Biology, Buddhism, and AI, Care as the driver of intelligence does not explicitly define care or intelligence.

19:30.480 --> 19:51.480
However, it proposes that care should be a central concept for understanding intelligence, particularly in the context of emerging forms of intelligence facilitated by advancements in AI and bioengineering.

19:51.480 --> 20:03.480
Care is described as a dynamic and practical concept that links goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence.

20:03.480 --> 20:16.480
The article also suggests that care should be a rubric that will remain relevant in the face of advancing AI and bioengineering.

20:16.480 --> 20:37.480
As for intelligence, the article acknowledges that traditional measures of intelligence may not be sufficient for evaluating and assigning moral responsibility to novel beings that are fundamentally different from traditional life forms.

20:37.480 --> 20:49.480
The authors propose that care should be at the forefront of considerations when assessing intelligence and moral responsibility.

20:49.480 --> 21:07.480
They argue that care provides a dynamic and robust foundation for determining moral duty and establishing relationships with diverse beings, regardless of their material composition or origin.

21:07.480 --> 21:12.480
What are some Biblical metaphors?

21:12.480 --> 21:25.480
Biblical metaphors are figures of speech that use Biblical narratives, characters, or themes to convey deeper meanings or insights.

21:25.480 --> 21:30.480
Some examples of Biblical metaphors include

21:30.480 --> 21:33.480
The Parable of the Sower

21:33.480 --> 21:34.480
The Parable of the Sower

21:34.480 --> 21:48.480
This parable compares the spread of the Gospel to the sowing of seeds, with different types of soil representing different levels of receptivity to the message.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.480
The Flood as a Natural Process

21:51.480 --> 21:52.480
The Biblical

21:52.480 --> 22:06.480
The biblical story of the Flood can be seen as a metaphor for the natural process of renewal and cleansing, as the waters wash away impurities and start anew.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
Gideon's Fleece

22:08.480 --> 22:24.480
The story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the scientific method, as Gideon tests the authenticity of a fleece by asking God to make it wet with dew or dry with heat.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.480
Elijah's Altar

22:27.480 --> 22:44.480
The story can also be seen as a metaphor for the scientific method, as Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal to build an altar that can withstand fire without being consumed.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
Jacob's Breeding Techniques

22:46.480 --> 23:05.480
The story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the scientific process of genetic selection, as Jacob selects certain animals for breeding based on their desirable traits, Hebrew terms and their meanings.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.480
Hebrew terms like

23:07.480 --> 23:08.480
Hebrew terms like

23:08.480 --> 23:15.480
Hebrew letter Kof, Hebrew point Zir, Hebrew letter Final Nun, Ken

23:15.480 --> 23:29.480
Hebrew letter Gimel, Hebrew point Dejish or Mopic, Hebrew letter Pei, Hebrew point Segal, Hebrew letter Resh, Gopher, and

23:29.480 --> 23:50.480
Hebrew letter Kof, Hebrew letter Kof, can be seen as metaphors for broader concepts or ideas, as they often have multiple layers of meaning and cultural significance.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.480
Biblical Characters and Themes

23:53.480 --> 24:08.480
Characters like Noah and Job can be seen as metaphors for broader biblical themes, as they embody certain virtues or struggles that are relevant to all people.

24:08.480 --> 24:14.480
These are just a few examples of biblical metaphors.

24:14.480 --> 24:33.480
By exploring and amplifying these metaphors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the richness and depth of biblical narratives, and draw connections to contemporary insights and interpretations.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.480
And for Noah's Ark

24:35.480 --> 25:01.480
The context information provided suggests that the story of Noah's Ark is not just about an actual boat of animals in the literal sense, but rather a symbolic reference to the animal-laden circle vessel of life, i.e., the 360-degree zodiac.

25:01.480 --> 25:25.480
This symbolic vessel, whose mainframe is the 0-9 number system and the cardinal cross in 12 months of the Earth's year, can be seen as a system or way of preserving eternal knowledge of the 360-degree field and structure of time and space.

25:25.480 --> 25:47.480
The author of the text suggests that this vessel can endure in the face of cataclysms, because it can be eternally rediscovered by humans, based on the geometries and dynamics of the Earth, solar system, and cosmos.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.480
It is a seed symbol of the universe.

25:48.480 --> 25:56.480
It is a seed symbol of the unified field the individual is born from and born into.

25:56.480 --> 26:14.480
The potential contained in this seed symbol is that the individual and the collective will evolve, in due course of time, to embody the consciousness of a dynamic unity, of a dynamic wholeness.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.480
And as a model of mind?

26:17.480 --> 26:37.480
Based on the provided context information, it appears that the human mind is considered a complex machine that is constantly engaged in constructing, adjusting, and reconstructing mental patterns.

26:37.480 --> 26:47.480
These mental patterns serve as the foundational blueprints of our understanding and interaction with the world.

26:47.480 --> 27:05.480
The mind is capable of integrating various inputs, including colors, shapes, sounds, complex equations, and abstract concepts, into these mental patterns.

27:05.480 --> 27:12.480
The construction of mental models is not limited by the type or source of inputs.

27:12.480 --> 27:30.480
The mind is also capable of engaging in purposeless play, where mental models are constructed just for the sake of it, highlighting our inherent need for mental simulation and play.

27:30.480 --> 27:47.480
Additionally, mental models can induce behaviors, where certain thinking processes and feelings become repetitive routes that one follows, like unchangeable habits.

27:47.480 --> 28:09.480
The human mind is also considered to have a theory of mind-tongue, which is central to human social interactions, communication, empathy, self-consciousness, moral judgment, and even religious beliefs.

28:09.480 --> 28:32.480
The ability to understand mental states of others, such as beliefs and desires, is considered a critical aspect of human social interactions and is considered to have emerged spontaneously as a byproduct of language models improving language skills.

28:32.480 --> 28:56.480
Overall, the human mind is a dynamic and complex system that is constantly constructing, adjusting, and reconstructing mental patterns, which serve as the foundational blueprints of our understanding and interaction with the world.

28:56.480 --> 29:01.480
I mean, Noah's Ark model of mind.

29:01.480 --> 29:19.480
The, Noah's Ark model of mind is a theory that suggests that the story of Noah's Ark can be seen as a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

29:19.480 --> 29:40.100
The Ark, in this theory, becomes a model of the mind itself, with distinct compartments used to segregate and arrange various elements, much like the mind separates and manages diverse types of information.

29:40.100 --> 29:54.320
The concept of the reed wall serving as a metaphor for how information leaks or filters into the mind through our senses is particularly intriguing.

29:54.320 --> 30:13.320
This theory is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world cafe tilde copyright, where different sub-units of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multi-scale decision maker.

30:13.320 --> 30:39.540
The Ark, in this theory, is seen as a treasure hunter or collector of interesting animals, much like a librarian might collect interesting books or an AI scientist might collect models and model-free methods that work or have interesting, novel, or salient features.

30:39.540 --> 30:51.500
The Ark is also seen as a model for the memory palettes and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

30:53.220 --> 30:55.000
Bruno's Lost Book?

30:55.920 --> 31:00.140
It is not clear what you are asking about.

31:01.020 --> 31:06.760
Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?

31:06.760 --> 31:10.060
Giordano Bruno

31:10.060 --> 31:10.160
Giordano Bruno

31:10.160 --> 31:23.360
Giordano Bruno was a philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer born in 1548 in Nola, near Naples.

31:23.720 --> 31:32.880
His family consisted of his father, a hired soldier, and his mother, a peasant.

31:32.880 --> 31:43.480
At the age of 11, Bruno was sent to Naples to study literature, logic, and dialectics.

31:44.220 --> 31:59.400
He later studied at the Monastery of San Domenico, where he faced conflicts with his superiors due to his excessively sociable, daring, and unrestrained character.

31:59.400 --> 32:07.800
In 1565, Bruno took monastic vows and was named Giordano.

32:08.800 --> 32:16.740
He spent nearly ten years in Naples, eventually becoming a full-fledged Catholic monk.

32:16.740 --> 32:28.260
In 1568, he completed his first work titled, The Ark of Noah, and dedicated it to Pope Pius V.

32:28.420 --> 32:35.080
At the age of 24, Giordano performed his first church service.

32:35.080 --> 32:48.000
In his free time, he immersed himself in the local library, studying the works of philosophers such as Aristotle and Ptolemy.

32:49.580 --> 33:01.220
Bruno's ideas challenged the prevailing religious dogmas of his time, and he faced charges of heresy by the Roman Catholic Church.

33:01.220 --> 33:11.120
In 1593, he was arrested by the Roman Inquisition and put on trial for his beliefs.

33:12.120 --> 33:23.120
Despite being given opportunities to recant, he remained steadfast in his convictions and refused to renounce his ideas.

33:23.120 --> 33:32.620
Consequently, he was found guilty of heresy and was burned at the stake in 1600.

33:34.520 --> 33:49.320
Bruno's tragic fate serves as a somber reminder of the historical struggles between the pursuit of knowledge and the forces of religious orthodoxy during a Renaissance era.

33:49.320 --> 34:05.600
His willingness to defend his ideas and face persecution for his beliefs has made him a symbol of intellectual courage and martyrdom for scientific and philosophical freedom.

34:05.600 --> 34:20.980
Despite his untimely end, Giordano Bruno's contributions to the fields of philosophy, cosmology, and the exploration of other worlds have endured,

34:21.520 --> 34:27.440
and he is now celebrated as a pioneer in the history of modern thought.

34:27.440 --> 34:43.700
His courage and dedication to his ideas have inspired subsequent generations of thinkers to pursue knowledge and challenge established beliefs, even in the face of adversity.

34:44.860 --> 34:50.360
Do you have a summary of Bruno's, the Ark of Noah?

34:50.360 --> 34:57.780
Yes, I have a summary of Bruno's, the Ark of Noah.

34:58.280 --> 35:09.840
Written in 1570, this satirical poem by Giordano Bruno is now lost and only known through a later dialogue.

35:10.760 --> 35:16.720
The poem involved satire targeting the church and worldly powers,

35:16.720 --> 35:21.420
with donkeys and foxes as allegorical figures.

35:22.340 --> 35:25.100
Donkeys represented the monks,

35:25.600 --> 35:29.200
while foxes symbolized worldly powers.

35:30.080 --> 35:40.120
The donkeys' discontent with their position on the Ark was a reflection of Bruno's criticism of the church and its hierarchy.

Retrieval Augmented Generation

35:44.560 --> 35:49.180
Retrieval Augmented Generation

35:49.180 --> 35:49.220
Retrieval Augmented Generation

35:49.220 --> 35:59.220
RAG is an architecture that enhances the capabilities of a large language model, LLM,

35:59.540 --> 36:03.000
by adding an information retrieval system.

36:03.480 --> 36:10.680
The unique feature of RAG is that it integrates an information retrieval mechanism

36:10.680 --> 36:18.560
that scours a vast set of data to fetch relevant information in response to a query.

36:19.520 --> 36:23.460
This data is then provided to the LLM,

36:23.460 --> 36:31.300
which uses this contextual information to generate a more informed and precise response.

36:31.300 --> 36:43.920
RAG combines the power of extensive data search capabilities with the advanced language generation skills of an LLM,

36:43.920 --> 36:50.680
allowing the model to pull in and leverage external knowledge more effectively.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.040
Relativistic Plenum Theory

36:55.040 --> 36:59.660
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum

36:59.660 --> 37:09.180
RSVP theory is a proposed concept that suggests the universe remains static in size

37:09.180 --> 37:15.280
while cosmic voids expand relative to dense regions of galactic filaments.

37:15.280 --> 37:25.440
This interplay between matter and negative vacuum is crucial during the formation of the inflatant field.

37:25.440 --> 37:32.980
The RSVP theory also proposes the cyclical nature of the universe,

37:33.440 --> 37:43.600
with material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflatant field expansion eventually reintegrating,

37:44.220 --> 37:49.720
suggesting the universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end

37:49.720 --> 37:54.280
but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.

37:54.280 --> 38:03.860
The theory is based on stochastic diffusion of local exotropies on Markov chain as in syncs.

38:04.780 --> 38:13.960
However, it is important to note that the RSVP theory is still in its early stages of development

38:13.960 --> 38:19.320
and more research is needed to fully understand its implications.

38:19.320 --> 38:33.260
Yes, I am familiar with your theory of Neanderthal lithophones.

38:33.260 --> 38:44.940
You proposed that Neanderthal developed musical instruments and sound producing devices much earlier than previously thought,

38:45.380 --> 38:52.760
challenging the notion that complex music making was exclusive to Homo sapiens.

38:52.760 --> 38:58.020
Your theory is supported by archaeological evidence,

38:58.520 --> 39:06.380
including the discovery of structures made from broken stalactites in Brunikano Cave,

39:06.900 --> 39:14.080
dating back approximately 176,500 years.

39:14.080 --> 39:22.900
These structures are seen as potential musical instruments, particularly lithophones.

39:22.900 --> 39:33.800
You also discussed the possibility of Neanderthals using simpler, readily available sound-producing tools,

39:34.280 --> 39:37.740
like striking stones or sticks together,

39:37.740 --> 39:43.320
as the initial stages of musical or rhythmic exploration.

39:45.140 --> 39:49.200
Any more unconventional or unusual theories?

39:50.360 --> 39:54.120
Based on the given context information,

39:54.900 --> 39:59.080
the author of the book, In Praise of Weirdness,

39:59.300 --> 40:05.460
argues that the fundamental structure of the cosmos and human consciousness

40:05.460 --> 40:09.380
are currently beyond our capacity to know,

40:09.760 --> 40:14.780
and that we do not have definitive answers to these questions.

40:15.280 --> 40:22.540
The author also argues that theories on these topics are both bizarre and dubious,

40:23.040 --> 40:26.380
and that given our weak epistemic position,

40:27.080 --> 40:32.640
our best big-picture cosmology and our best theories of consciousness

40:32.640 --> 40:37.060
are strange, tentative, and modish.

40:37.060 --> 40:43.740
The author also discusses the varieties of cosmological weirdness,

40:44.220 --> 40:48.600
including relativity theory and quantum mechanics,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.620
and the many-worlds hypothesis.

40:52.740 --> 40:58.500
The author suggests that collaboration with researchers and academics,

40:58.500 --> 41:01.260
literature contribution,

41:02.080 --> 41:03.400
staying updated,

41:04.060 --> 41:10.240
and perfecting our instruments can help in understanding these topics better.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.420
Do you know the author of the book on weirdness?

41:16.480 --> 41:18.120
I apologize,

41:19.060 --> 41:26.100
but I do not have access to the specific book on weirdness that you are referring to.

41:26.100 --> 41:32.000
Can you please provide me with more information about the book,

41:32.360 --> 41:36.520
such as the title, author, or publisher,

41:37.200 --> 41:40.000
so that I can assist you better?

41:41.620 --> 41:43.600
It was Eric Schwitz-Giebel.

41:44.880 --> 41:50.000
Eric Schwitz-Giebel is a philosopher and cognitive scientist

41:50.000 --> 41:55.020
who has written extensively on the topic of skepticism

41:55.020 --> 41:57.860
and the limits of human knowledge.

41:58.800 --> 42:03.520
He has also written about the role of science in society

42:03.520 --> 42:08.080
and the potential dangers of scientific misconduct.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.420
In his work,

42:10.900 --> 42:17.660
he has argued that while science can provide valuable insights into the world,

42:17.660 --> 42:24.400
it is important to remain critical and skeptical of scientific claims,

42:25.020 --> 42:29.080
particularly when they are based on limited evidence

42:29.080 --> 42:31.860
or are subject to interpretation.

42:33.140 --> 42:37.980
He has also emphasized the importance of transparency

42:37.980 --> 42:41.960
and accountability in scientific research,

42:41.960 --> 42:47.680
and has advocated for greater public engagement with science

42:47.680 --> 42:52.820
to ensure that it remains a force for good in society.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.780
Monica Anderson's Work

42:56.780 --> 43:03.660
Monica Anderson is an accomplished and experienced AI researcher

43:03.660 --> 43:08.960
with a unique focus on experimental AI epistemology.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.080
Her background in computer science,

43:13.640 --> 43:20.080
industrial AI, NLP, ML, and NLU,

43:20.520 --> 43:25.220
along with her extensive experience with deep neural networks,

43:25.900 --> 43:29.360
demonstrates her expertise in the field.

43:29.360 --> 43:34.160
Anderson has been working with deep neural networks

43:34.160 --> 43:38.980
since before their widespread recognition in 2012

43:38.980 --> 43:42.880
and specifies using DDNN,

43:43.280 --> 43:45.620
deep discrete neuron networks,

43:45.860 --> 43:49.460
as opposed to DL, deep learning,

43:50.100 --> 43:55.300
suggesting a distinctive approach to her neural network designs.

43:55.300 --> 44:00.880
Her work in the realm of experimental AI epistemology

44:00.880 --> 44:05.120
contributes to the advancement of AI understanding,

44:05.840 --> 44:08.440
reasoning, and abstraction.

44:10.380 --> 44:11.920
Organic Learning

44:11.920 --> 44:15.980
Organic Learning, OL,

44:16.600 --> 44:19.480
is a type of machine learning algorithm

44:19.480 --> 44:22.980
that is designed for sequence processing,

44:22.980 --> 44:26.880
such as processing text or speech.

44:27.700 --> 44:33.160
It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain,

44:33.620 --> 44:37.300
and aims to build a neural network-like structure,

44:37.920 --> 44:39.620
called a connectome,

44:40.080 --> 44:44.220
to represent the understanding of the input stream.

44:45.100 --> 44:47.440
The learner starts out empty

44:47.440 --> 44:50.400
and incrementally builds its connectome

44:50.400 --> 44:55.280
by discovering recurring sequential patterns in its input.

44:56.160 --> 45:00.700
The learning process is performed character by character,

45:01.360 --> 45:05.460
without the need for parsing the input into words.

45:06.280 --> 45:09.800
Each character activates a corresponding,

45:10.440 --> 45:12.120
character input neuron

45:12.120 --> 45:14.880
that signals other neurons,

45:15.440 --> 45:18.180
creating a cascade of signaling

45:18.180 --> 45:21.360
to determine the meaning of the sentence

45:21.360 --> 45:24.400
and where to attach a new understanding.

45:25.520 --> 45:29.120
The best ideas in the network are rewarded

45:29.120 --> 45:32.480
and the less useful ideas are punished

45:32.480 --> 45:35.560
through reinforcement learning, OL.

45:35.560 --> 45:43.260
The best ideas are allowed to breed with other good ideas

45:43.260 --> 45:46.400
to produce even better abstractions,

45:46.920 --> 45:49.500
speeding up the learning process.

45:50.520 --> 45:54.700
This is similar to sexual reproduction in nature

45:54.700 --> 45:56.980
and allows multiple inventions

45:56.980 --> 46:00.320
to merge into a single better solution.

46:00.320 --> 46:03.060
The learner creates,

46:03.580 --> 46:05.300
as its main output,

46:05.780 --> 46:07.680
a file containing a,

46:08.040 --> 46:09.700
node wiring list

46:09.700 --> 46:11.940
describing which neurons

46:11.940 --> 46:14.460
connect to which other neurons.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.260
Such a competence creation event

46:18.260 --> 46:19.940
is typically scheduled

46:19.940 --> 46:22.440
after each 10 million characters

46:22.440 --> 46:24.960
of corpus have been read.

46:25.820 --> 46:28.360
Given a competence file name,

46:28.360 --> 46:31.040
UM1 loads it list

46:31.040 --> 46:34.080
and recreates the learned neural structure

46:34.080 --> 46:36.020
and then uses that

46:36.020 --> 46:39.140
as the basis of its natural language

46:39.140 --> 46:41.260
understanding service.

46:42.940 --> 46:44.760
Questions for later?

46:46.180 --> 46:51.380
Yes, I can provide you with questions for later.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.380
What topics or subjects

46:54.380 --> 46:56.960
would you like me to focus on?

46:58.360 --> 47:01.840
Explain Multidimensional Dialogue

47:01.840 --> 47:05.680
Multidimensional Dialogue

47:05.680 --> 47:08.000
is a type of dialogue system

47:08.000 --> 47:09.860
that presents a topic

47:09.860 --> 47:12.000
as interconnected tunnels

47:12.000 --> 47:15.220
or branches for open exploration,

47:15.880 --> 47:18.380
rather than separate modalities

47:18.380 --> 47:19.500
or disciplines

47:19.500 --> 47:21.440
that are not integrated.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.180
The user can navigate

47:24.180 --> 47:25.780
diverse perspectives

47:25.780 --> 47:28.460
in one overarching space,

47:29.020 --> 47:31.460
taking a self-directed journey

47:31.460 --> 47:32.720
through the topic

47:32.720 --> 47:34.600
rather than being led

47:34.600 --> 47:36.260
through a set sequence

47:36.260 --> 47:38.180
of modes or disciplines.

47:39.180 --> 47:40.740
The system tracks

47:40.740 --> 47:42.220
what has been covered

47:42.220 --> 47:43.840
and can point out

47:43.840 --> 47:46.060
remaining discussion areas

47:46.060 --> 47:47.960
or recap key points

47:47.960 --> 47:49.360
from other branches.

47:49.360 --> 47:52.840
This kind of explorable,

47:53.740 --> 47:55.640
multidimensional interface

47:55.640 --> 47:59.000
could provide more open-ended discussion

47:59.000 --> 48:02.360
than always following a set sequence

48:02.360 --> 48:04.520
of questions or topics.

48:04.520 --> 48:10.140
Some ways a multidimensional dialogue system

48:10.140 --> 48:12.480
could differ from other approaches

48:12.480 --> 48:16.840
include providing interconnected branching paths

48:16.840 --> 48:19.820
on the topic for open exploration,

48:20.520 --> 48:24.740
enabling the user to take a self-directed journey

48:24.740 --> 48:25.960
through the topic

48:25.960 --> 48:27.940
rather than being led

48:27.940 --> 48:29.600
through a set sequence

48:29.600 --> 48:31.500
of modes or disciplines

48:31.500 --> 48:34.660
and representing conversations

48:34.660 --> 48:37.700
or concepts spatially or visually,

48:38.380 --> 48:41.720
not just through text or verbal modes.

48:42.580 --> 48:44.460
The explorable structure

48:44.460 --> 48:46.760
could be graphically mapped,

48:47.240 --> 48:49.520
allowing users other ways

48:49.520 --> 48:50.660
of understanding

48:50.660 --> 48:53.620
and engaging with the dialogue.

48:53.620 --> 48:58.700
A three-dimensional tunneling approach

48:58.700 --> 49:02.300
that provides multiple branching paths

49:02.300 --> 49:03.840
or decision points

49:03.840 --> 49:05.760
could help make dialogue

49:05.760 --> 49:06.900
less linear

49:06.900 --> 49:08.420
and mitigate biases

49:08.420 --> 49:12.360
from focusing on a single discussion thread,

49:13.160 --> 49:15.460
representing conversations

49:15.460 --> 49:18.580
as explorable tunnels, rooms,

49:19.080 --> 49:22.460
or spaces with many possible directions

49:22.460 --> 49:24.800
rather than a single path

49:24.800 --> 49:26.840
is an interesting idea.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.240
This kind of highly structured

49:30.240 --> 49:32.460
yet open-ended dialogue interface

49:33.280 --> 49:35.840
could give readers more agency

49:35.840 --> 49:36.460
and control

49:37.080 --> 49:40.080
in navigating a complex discussion

49:40.080 --> 49:42.900
rather than being led down

49:42.900 --> 49:44.960
a predetermined path.

49:46.280 --> 49:49.880
However, there are also challenges

49:49.880 --> 49:52.340
to developing and implementing

49:52.340 --> 49:54.180
such an approach,

49:54.680 --> 49:56.680
including the complexity

49:56.680 --> 50:01.200
of creating a multidimensional dialogue interface,

50:01.700 --> 50:04.020
the risk of being overwhelming

50:04.020 --> 50:05.300
or confusing

50:05.300 --> 50:07.820
if there are too many branches

50:07.820 --> 50:10.080
or possible directions,

50:10.760 --> 50:12.660
and the need to accommodate

50:12.660 --> 50:14.800
different levels of interest

50:14.800 --> 50:17.780
in breadth or depth among users.

50:17.780 --> 50:21.240
To test the effectiveness

50:21.240 --> 50:24.780
of a multidimensional dialogue system,

50:25.280 --> 50:26.640
it could be compared

50:26.640 --> 50:30.260
to a more standard linear dialogue system

50:30.260 --> 50:32.120
in terms of user experience

50:32.920 --> 50:34.260
and understanding.

50:35.360 --> 50:37.060
Open-ended questions

50:37.060 --> 50:39.220
could also be included

50:39.220 --> 50:40.560
to get feedback

50:40.560 --> 50:42.340
on what users like

50:42.340 --> 50:44.760
or dislike about the system,

50:44.760 --> 50:47.000
and recurring patterns

50:47.000 --> 50:48.040
and responses

50:48.040 --> 50:49.740
could be looked for.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.600
Comparisons

50:51.600 --> 50:53.180
and user feedback

50:53.180 --> 50:54.260
could reveal

50:54.260 --> 50:55.860
the pros and cons

50:55.860 --> 50:58.580
of the multidimensional approach.

51:00.280 --> 51:01.920
Do you know my game

51:01.920 --> 51:03.300
Hey Pluprixies?

51:04.720 --> 51:05.560
Yes,

51:06.040 --> 51:07.220
I am familiar

51:07.220 --> 51:08.440
with your game

51:08.440 --> 51:09.780
Hey Pluprixies.

51:09.780 --> 51:12.240
It is a unique game

51:12.240 --> 51:14.120
that combines elements

51:14.120 --> 51:15.700
from various games

51:15.700 --> 51:17.200
and inspirations,

51:17.760 --> 51:19.360
such as stars,

51:20.520 --> 51:21.020
descent,

51:21.820 --> 51:23.020
minesweeper,

51:23.580 --> 51:24.620
bubble pop,

51:25.240 --> 51:27.160
logical gate circuits,

51:27.780 --> 51:28.660
and more.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.780
The game features

51:30.780 --> 51:33.720
an element of space exploration,

51:34.360 --> 51:36.560
where players visit planets

51:36.560 --> 51:37.660
and pop bubbles

51:37.660 --> 51:41.300
associated with vocabulary words.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.740
It also includes

51:43.740 --> 51:45.820
a typing tutor aspect,

51:46.380 --> 51:49.420
thus serving as an educational game

51:49.420 --> 51:50.800
to help players

51:50.800 --> 51:53.340
improve their typing skills.

51:54.680 --> 51:56.000
Hippoprixies aims

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
to simulate the evolution

51:58.000 --> 51:59.300
of the universe

51:59.300 --> 52:00.020
using

52:00.020 --> 52:01.340
a Zing Syncs.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.760
The game employs

52:03.760 --> 52:05.460
is a Vitoshkian ladder

52:05.460 --> 52:08.080
of proximal graduations,

52:08.580 --> 52:10.200
adjusting its gameplay

52:10.200 --> 52:12.260
based on the skill level

52:12.260 --> 52:13.380
of the player.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.400
For infants,

52:15.920 --> 52:17.240
it simplifies

52:17.240 --> 52:19.380
into a bubble pop game.

52:20.100 --> 52:22.340
For elementary schoolers,

52:22.740 --> 52:23.740
it becomes

52:23.740 --> 52:25.020
a typing tutor.

52:25.880 --> 52:28.060
If no viewer is detected,

52:28.680 --> 52:29.840
it defaults

52:29.840 --> 52:32.040
to a screensaver tutorial.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.380
The game features

52:34.380 --> 52:35.820
a guide bot,

52:36.300 --> 52:37.540
which automatically

52:37.540 --> 52:39.680
plays through the tutorial,

52:40.440 --> 52:42.260
demonstrating possible

52:42.260 --> 52:44.320
gameplay and controls,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and revealing easter eggs.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.700
There is a global reset function,

52:51.360 --> 52:53.480
triggered by pressing the

52:53.480 --> 52:54.880
G key,

52:55.360 --> 52:57.380
which returns all players

52:57.380 --> 52:59.520
to the start of the game,

52:59.520 --> 53:01.060
making them

53:01.060 --> 53:02.740
lose all progress.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.460
However,

53:05.140 --> 53:06.300
a setting called

53:06.300 --> 53:07.200
auto-blink

53:07.200 --> 53:08.820
can protect players

53:08.820 --> 53:10.780
from the global reset,

53:11.240 --> 53:12.300
allowing them

53:12.300 --> 53:14.080
to keep their points.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.860
The game incorporates

53:16.860 --> 53:17.820
a strategy

53:17.820 --> 53:18.860
of finding

53:18.860 --> 53:20.860
the most nested bubble,

53:21.220 --> 53:22.700
innermost scope,

53:23.120 --> 53:24.040
and players

53:24.040 --> 53:24.520
are encouraged

53:25.220 --> 53:26.020
to blink

53:26.020 --> 53:26.940
when passing

53:26.940 --> 53:28.360
through the boundary

53:28.360 --> 53:29.280
of a bubble

53:29.280 --> 53:31.140
to avoid poppin' it.

53:32.820 --> 53:33.940
What do you know

53:33.940 --> 53:35.420
about SpherePop

53:35.420 --> 53:36.600
and Pipsqueak?

53:38.220 --> 53:39.220
SpherePop

53:39.220 --> 53:40.320
and Pipsqueak

53:40.320 --> 53:41.600
are two concepts

53:41.600 --> 53:42.180

53:52.980 --> 53:54.160
and logic,

53:54.740 --> 53:56.580
making it an interactive

53:56.580 --> 53:58.060
and visual way

53:58.060 --> 53:58.980
to program.

54:00.060 --> 54:01.360
It is designed

54:01.360 --> 54:03.020
to be more intuitive

54:03.020 --> 54:04.380
and engaging

54:04.380 --> 54:05.060
than traditional

54:05.660 --> 54:07.560
programming languages.

54:08.760 --> 54:09.060

with a focus

54:18.540 --> 54:19.700
on simplicity

54:19.700 --> 54:21.620
and ease of use.

54:22.440 --> 54:23.620
It is intended

54:23.620 --> 54:24.920
to be a fun

54:24.920 --> 54:26.440
and engaging way

54:26.440 --> 54:27.700
to teach children

54:27.700 --> 54:29.640
programming concepts.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.960
While SpherePop

54:31.960 --> 54:33.060
and Pipsqueak

54:33.060 --> 54:33.860
are different

54:33.860 --> 54:35.860
in their specific goals

54:35.860 --> 54:37.100
and design,

54:37.580 --> 54:38.860
they both share

54:38.860 --> 54:40.120
the common goal

54:40.120 --> 54:41.760
of making programming

54:41.760 --> 54:43.100
more accessible

54:43.100 --> 54:44.480

Chicken or egg? Scientists doubt and curiosity. Because I like, I'm, Amy Lamott said, and this is
unrelated, but I just love this phrase. And I find myself applying it to other things. She said
that help is the sunny side of control. And I was like, Oh, that's good. But this idea that
doubt feels like the dark side of curiosity or curiosity is the sunny side. So help me, scientists.
Yeah, I mean, I do think that I don't think it's the dark side necessarily. But when you,
but in order to be curious about what's there, you have to be doubtful of what's there as well.
You have to be curious about what's not there. When you see a hole in something,
it's like the negative space that forms the image, right? And when I feel most
curious is after I realize there's a hole in some explanation, and then I just can't stop
thinking about it. I can't stop figuring out what, how do you, how do you come up with a better
explanation or what's missing there? What does that entail about the rest of what I thought I knew
about something?

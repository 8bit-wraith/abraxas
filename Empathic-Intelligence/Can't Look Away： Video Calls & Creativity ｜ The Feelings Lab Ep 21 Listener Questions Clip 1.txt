Was that the part that you started to I don't want to put words in your mouth and say take
issue but you were like I don't know about that right before I cut you off was it the
idea that if you're gays drifts that you're not focused is that the thing that you were
saying like I don't know if I align with that yeah I think what I well I think that it is
a way of explaining the findings that I don't think it's wrong I think it's just
the they need to think about sort of the social significance of it a little bit more than taking
your out in terms of purely I think their explanation is purely cognitive and not social
yeah and you know creativity is also something that comes out of a certain kind of focus different
but it's nice it's more focused internally on ideas that are being produced in your brain
and focus on ideas that are coming from the environment that's the difference and we're able
to do that you know when in a person I think the key thing is my explanation and this is something
probably worth testing is that when you're in the same environment to somebody and you look away
it's very clear to them that you're not looking at anything specific because they're in the
environment with you and they know that there's nothing there okay but when you're on video
chat and you look away it looks like you're distracted that's why you can't you can't look away
and Alan and I have run into this numerous times where he allows me to stare off into
space hours at a time and it's where I derive a lot of my creative ideas from but I assure him
I'm not ignoring him I'm not it's funny they tap on they do mention that in in the clip the
the significance of a communal space and how uh and they don't really dig deeper into it like you
just have there but you're right I didn't even think of that if we're in the same space I know
what it is that you're looking at even if it's not me versus now if you were to just look off screen
I'll sit here going what the hell is he distracted by I'm talking to him right now and I could see
how that could impede uh creative progress and collaborative progress but um very interesting

What do you think, Alan?
How do we learn from others?
What are the most important things?
What are socio-effective processes look like, man?
I think that, you know, there's, there's affect, which drives cognition and kind of
reverberates through our body, through expressions, through physiology and all of that.
So at every moment, we're kind of traversing this tree of thought and each fork and each
branch.
We're making decisions.
What's the next thing I want to think about?
How do I want to continue this thought?
And it can't be based on another thought, it's based on emotion, right?
And so emotions kind of, they direct our thoughts, but, you know, we're not, we've evolved as
social organisms.
We don't think alone, we think together, right?
And so the way that we think together is by signaling to each other a little bit about
what we're thinking, what's the direction, what's the objective.
And that's why, you know, we learn really from each other's expressions and looking
at each other and deciding together what's interesting and having conversations and all
of that.
And so that, to me, is social-effective learning.
And it's sort of at the core of what it means to structure relationships and society and
culture, but also, you know, even from the first moments of learning when infants are
learning from their mothers, how they're learning from their mothers.
And, you know, in the same way that emotions direct thoughts, emotions direct learning because
you can't learn without knowing what is important to learn next, right?
You can't learn without an objective.
There's an infinite number of things you could look into and, you know, try to describe in
the world, but we decide, you know, these are the things that are important, the things
that, you know, are surprising or interesting or satisfying or scary or amusing.
Thank you.

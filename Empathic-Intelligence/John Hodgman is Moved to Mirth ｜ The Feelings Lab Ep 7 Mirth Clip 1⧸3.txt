According to Google Books and Graham Viewer, use of the word mirth peaked around the 1820s
and then declined steadily for a hundred years or so, hitting an all-time low around
the mid-80s.
Please welcome to the show author, actor, humorist, the great John Hodgman, everybody.
John, thank you for being here.
How are you doing, sir?
Thank you so much.
I am as okay as possible.
I'm really excited to talk about mirth and really, frankly, moved to mirth by the idea
that mirth peaked in the 1820s.
Isn't that something?
What a mirthful decade, the rise of the First Industrial Revolution, child labor, slavery,
the Missouri Compromise, 1820.
What a laugh that was to invent the state of Maine, so as to the slave state of Missouri.
Yeah, a lot of fun was happening in the 1820s.

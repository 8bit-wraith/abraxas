But an issue, but I can't help but be reminded of, you know, the passing of the Queen, there's
just a lot of emotions that are coming up across the world, and it's this conversation
of what is the appropriate response to the passing of this person and how, how do you
define that?
Yeah, I'm not going to judge anyone who might have an inappropriate response, but having
said that, you know, I live in Switzerland now, so I'm not in Britain as it's happening.
But I was there when Princess Diana died, now of course the circumstances were very
different, she was a younger woman, it was tragic circumstances, and I am by no means
a monarchist, but there was a sense of terrible sense of grief and sadness that kind of hit
us all.
And I even felt, this was some time ago, I was a relatively young man I think, but I
even felt about, I felt inclined to write a letter to her sons, because those were the
most difficult pictures I think for most people were her two young sons standing there having
just lost their mother, and you know, the number of flowers that were given and just walking
along the street, you felt like people were down, and it really felt like what you could
call a collective emotion, because yeah, I mean, I felt that maybe I should even write
letters to the two boys saying, you know, you're going to be okay, which is strange in a way,
because you know, little boys lose their mothers every day, and you know, if anyone's
going to be okay, it's going to be two princes, one of whom is fair to the throne of Great
Britain, but perhaps I was talking emotionally rather than financially, right?
Right.
You know, the whole experience was heavy, and I can only imagine that the people of Great
Britain are feeling it.
What's different this time is that I'm in Switzerland, and to have so many of my colleagues
wish me well, and say that they're thinking of me, or that, you know, that they felt sad
when the Queen passed on what have you, that's been an eye-opener for me as well.

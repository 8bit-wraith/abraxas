What, what is a vocal burst for those that are still in the dark?
Why are they so important?
I figured you could help shine a light on that one for me.
Yeah.
I mean, vocal bursts are these non-linguistic vocalizations that we make, like laughs and
sighs and gasps and yelps and, and, and, and, and, and ...
Hang on, give me five more.
I can't do my blood cruelling scream today, Matt.
It's going to hurt my voice.
Ah.
This is what the people tune in for, Alan.
All right.
But, you know, these sounds are incredibly powerful.
They're rich.
They're ubiquitous, particularly laughter.
But every sound we make, and huzz, and huzz, and huzz, and they just happen all the time.
And until recently have been largely overlooked in emotion science and not to mention machine
learning.
And there's just not much data out there to train algorithms to understand these vocal
expressions.
Yeah.
You mentioned they're ubiquitous.
They're non-linguistic noises.
So that means they're universal.
Do they vary from culture to culture or is it across the board, human beings?
This is what we do.
When we look at vocal bursts versus facial expressions versus speech prosody language,
vocal bursts are the most universal across all of the cultures we've looked at.
Generally, I mean, we just ran a study with six, sorry, five different cultures.
We had hundreds of thousands of samples from tens of thousands of participants.
And we'd identified that there were 25 dimensions of vocal bursts total and 24 of them were
preserved across cultures very, very well significantly.
So vocal bursts, it's weird to like facial expression, we did the same thing and it
was 17 out of 28.
So vocal bursts are incredibly cross-cultural.

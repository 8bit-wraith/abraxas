An idea, a somewhat controversial idea from Oprah, if you can believe it, not too long
ago.
And I'm paraphrasing a bit of what she said here, but essentially the point was, if you
feel awe, you believe in God.
And again, I'm paraphrasing, I'm taking things, but that was more or less the concept that
she was conveying, is that if you feel awe, you believe in God.
And I want to unpack that.
Why do we connect awe to spirituality?
Is awe inherently spiritual?
And I'd love to get your perspective on that, on awe and spirituality, not Oprah.
However, if you do have a hot take on Oprah, I'm willing to pivot.
Sure.
That's putting it out there.
Sure.
Well, I think for me, when I'm experiencing awe, I'm experiencing the preciousness of
life.
Everything seems so, everything that's alive seems so precious and like something I want
to care for.
And you know, so even when you're saying like, you know, well, we could do, we can, we have
too much.
And I was like, no, let's have more of it.
Because what I know is when I feel awe in relationship to the natural world, I want to care for it.
When I feel awe in relationship to the silverware in my kitchen that I'm picking up, I want
to care for it.
I want to make sure it's clean and it's put away well.
And it's a cure for sort of over-consumerism because I have so much love and care for the
objects that are directly in my environment.
So I think it's, you know, I don't have to jump to God, but it's an incredible celebration
of life, of the glory of life.

You know, we talked about the evolutionary advantage to awe and desire and horror and
how that brings people together.
But I feel like anxiety kind of can cause a person to isolate and avoid others as opposed
to bring people together.
So if we have any more thoughts on the usefulness or the evolutionary advantage, I'd love to
open that up a little bit more if you got anything in there.
Well, I think, as George was saying, there is room for people to be sort of the first
alarm when there might be a lion in the bush and the monkeys are in the field.
Some monkey is going to be the first monkey to start yelping and maybe 95% of the time
they're wrong and everybody ignores them.
But it's useful to have what's the chance of precipitation today.
Some monkeys that are more attuned to potential threats and some monkeys that are less attuned.
And so I think diversity in the levels of anxiety is probably something that's to our
evolutionary advantage.
Why did monkey in the bush not catch on like canary in a coal mine?
Is it because there is an alliteration?
Well, the canary usually doesn't do well at the end of that story.
I was picking up the same thing.
I was like, monkey in a bush is definitely an expression.
We're going to make that catch big time.
Yeah, it's a more positive take.

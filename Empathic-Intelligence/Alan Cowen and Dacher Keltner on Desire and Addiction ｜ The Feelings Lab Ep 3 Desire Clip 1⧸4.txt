So then what is the part of the brain that takes over for a lot of people after the fact?
You hear all the time, it's not the destination, it's the journey.
Like what evolutionary advantage is there to the feeling of actually acquiring the thing
you desire and then still feeling unfulfilled?
What do we know about that?
Well, there's like negative reward prediction.
We predict that we'll get something and if we don't get enough of it, if we don't get as much
as we think, there's actually a negative response in dopaminergic cells and it makes us want more.
You see that in addiction, for example, when you're addicted to drugs, it's because suddenly
you need more dopamine to get the regular reward response, even the regular desire response.
So, yeah, it's fundamentally a prediction thing.
It's about the brain predicting when you need to exert energy to get what you want and when
it's most beneficial to do that.
It's interesting and this is where neuroscience is cool, right?
How do we, to your question, how do we pull apart desire from getting the thing, enjoying it,
living a life with the thing, right, whatever you may desire?
And there's a lot of interesting work on the opioid system is about savoring and enjoying
and feeling comfortable in your skin with the thing that you have love, if you will.
And opioids are, we have opioid epidemics, which are tragic, but they are in some sense about
belonging and enjoying the presence of things.
And in some sense, the epidemic is about yearning for that kind of experience.
So, the neuroscience helps us pull apart desire from enjoying love, which is important.

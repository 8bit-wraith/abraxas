What does the psychology say, you know, about what are the kind of signals and indicators
and I'm curious how it compares in these different domains where the psychology doesn't usually
study customer service calls, doesn't usually study sales calls.
But in general, interactions, if you, you know, what are the big things and typical
laughter, let's say, people laughing together, huge sign of whether they could be friends.
Absolutely.
Relationships, do you see that in customer service and sales as well?
No doubt.
And so this sort of, this sort of joint, joint laughter.
So we, we even have an edge because part of what we do is we're trying to not just change
customer service, service behavior, we're also trying to encourage them and make their
lives better, make their jobs better and, you know, more fun because it's not, it's not
as easy as I think you guys said at the start, right, it's not the easiest job.
So when we see like really positive moments in an interaction, we'll give somebody a nudge,
which is, you know, a visual equivalent of a high five.
Well done.
Right.
Yeah.
And now we absolutely look at those kind of moments of sort of joint activity and
join that.
Totally.
Yeah.
Yeah.

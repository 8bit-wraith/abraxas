What just happened to me when you were describing that experiment and I like physically I wouldn't
say cringed but like I felt like oof I would hate to have to do that where you say oh we
videotape them singing and then we make them watch it why why did I have that response
and maybe I'm asking way too personal a question and this is no longer about emotion and it's
just about me but I have the microphone why why did I feel that way what was that is that
second hand embarrassment well that cringe yeah I mean there there are these you know
to be great to hear Ali talk about contagious emotion from a comedian standpoint you know
there are great studies showing if I blush my friends around me blush so Jess and Ellen
would blush if I get embarrassed they start getting embarrassed because part of our identity
is collective right part of it is like we're all together I made a mistake and the people
around me are feeling that sense of mortification and and it's really it's one of the great
mysteries of why that's so powerful and some people some there's actually a measure of
your blush proneness where some people are so blush prone not only do they blush when
other people blush they blush if someone on television makes a mistake they even blush
like if they hear the word blush they're like oh my god I'm blushing so you know it's a
it tells us how linked we are in in our emotional lives yeah

So the humans are part of it. They're the people we need the humans. They're the best
at identifying the new things and spotting the new things. And then once your humans
identify that, and I understand that I'm oversimplifying to a great degree, but we'll say the humans
identify the new things. That's when the AI steps in to then detect the things the humans
found. Am I following that? Is that correct, Ish? Right?
Yes, there's a few different things that play as part of this whole process. So one part of it
is, of course, the training data that we feed to our AI. And there we need humans to accurately
tag the data. So that's why we built these huge databases of tagged content. But then another
part of it is that there are certain things that just AI in general has a really hard time as
you know, being able to identify. And some of the biggest challenges we have there is, of course,
context, its modality, its referentiality, and its sarcasm. So there as well, we use a combination
where first the comments are run by our AI. And then if the AI doesn't have high enough confidence
in these types of situations, then there is a human or several humans that will then kind of weigh in
and ultimately we can then use that data for training purposes. And then we also have a lot of
quality assurance in place because of course, everything on social media is public. So we
need to make sure that we maintain the highest possible accuracy at all times when we take
actions. So there's a lot of different parts, but ultimately all the time, it's AI and humans
working very closely together. And that's really what we believe is essential to be able to do this
well. Yeah, now we hear that a lot, especially in the conversations we're having.

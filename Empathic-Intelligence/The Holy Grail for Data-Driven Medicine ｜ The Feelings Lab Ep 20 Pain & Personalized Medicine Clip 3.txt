So I think more along the line of what Alan was saying, what can we do to gather information
that can help us better detect what pain expressions exist already or what other factors that may
be actionable in terms of treatment, right?
So whether a patient's male, female, whatever culture, like how can we develop models to
better understand and treat these patients?
And can we demonstrate to ourselves that the treatments that we have available are the
right treatments for one and then are also functioning the way that we, meaning the clinician
and the patient together, hope that they would.
And again, I'm just going to use the complicated word again.
It's really complicated.
Super complicated.
It's hard to do this with your brain, right?
I mean, to sit down and after a lot of clinical training, it's really hard and takes a lot
of energy and focus to do that on an individual level, much less try to define a model that
can operate at that scale.
So I think what Alan was suggesting is some form of decision support, which is kind of
the holy grail for personalized medicine, data-driven medicine, whatever you want to
call it.
And it requires a lot of really thoughtful people getting together to understand which
features are important.
And then also, how do we manage all this data and what sort of outcomes are we interested
in targeting that?

When we're in REM sleep and we see someone's eyes moving around and darting back and forth,
there is this thought that that is us, our brain, looking around inside in our dream
world.
Alan, did I remember that incorrectly?
Is that a theory or is that something we kind of know, elaborate on that a little bit
for me?
Because I was so into that idea.
What do we know about that?
I read a study and I don't know how much I trust it, but I read a study that they had
people who could lose a dream that they followed their eye movements and the people were instructed
I think in a double-blind way or single-blind, I guess, it couldn't be double-blind, but basically
like you have to move your eyes either left and right or up and down when you're in your
dream or something like that to that effect.
They verified that during sleep, which they can measure when somebody is asleep based
on their EEG signal, that the people's eyes were actually moving in that way.
Yuki might know about that.
Yeah, just to add some details.
That study was basically about in a smooth eye movement.
So when you have something in your finger in front of you and continuous moving, you
can continuously track the position of the finger, but it's hard when you close your
eyes and imagine something moving smoothly.
So eye movements tend to get juggly, but in lucid dreaming, they just imagine finger
in front of them and the smooths be moving and they can make a very smooth eye movement.
So that indicates that lucid dreaming is not like imaginary.
So it's more like our perception or our daily wake experience.
So that's interesting.
And as for rapid eye movement, rapid eye movement is not smooth.
It's just jumping.
And the theory is saying that it's tracking something in the scene.
And actually, we are very interested in that theory and we try to prove or disprove that
by making a picture while subjects having rapid eye movement.
So just before a right word eye movement, if there's something salient in the image
to the right, maybe that's kind of evidence that the rapid eye movement is for following.
But another theory is that it's just random.

Why is it that the the negative experience is travel farther? You tell more people about
a bad experience than you did about a good one. At least that's what I've heard. What's
the science behind that? What's the thought process behind that? Why are we jerks?
I think we're fundamentally relationship oriented and social interaction oriented
and whether social interaction is going good or bad. I think I think Josh is probably a hundred
percent on point. Like if you if somebody's being polite to you, you would assume they have good
intent. So they're at least trying to figure out your problems, right? Right. You know,
even if they're not addressing them that quickly, I think they correlate maybe they are. But if
they're not, then you still have the assumption that they are doing a good job. If somebody's
treating you with disrespect, you assume they're not doing a good job. And even if they're getting
to it fast, maybe you assume they could have done it faster. And so we're very oriented to
these cues as humans, like we're just listening to signs of empathy all the time. And I think
that's really the discriminator there. We're just going to add to it. One of the things that we found,
which I think is increasingly well understood is also I think fascinating, which is we make that
decision about whether we're well treated by the way we're interacted with, not by what people say.
So the customer services agent can follow exactly the same script, exactly the same interaction,
but in milliseconds between how fast they respond to a query of yours will make you decide whether
you've been heard or whether that they're listening to your nut. And then for you'll make a judgment
that will then possibly stick with you for a long time afterwards.
Yeah.

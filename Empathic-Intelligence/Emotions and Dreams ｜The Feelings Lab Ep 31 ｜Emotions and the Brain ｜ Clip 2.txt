Do we know, is there a difference between how our brains handle emotions in our waking state versus when we're asleep, or is it all the same?
Yeah, that's a difficult question. And actually, emotion in sleep or dreaming have been studied by, you know, a report after awakening. And there's a study showing that majority of dream reports are emotionally negative.
Interesting.
Maybe 60% to 70%. So, you know, so, yeah, yeah, so that makes sense to me, you know, so, yeah, I don't seem really joyful, you know, doing this. So, yeah, and so this theory, you know, try to link that, you know, to some healing process of the mind or some
interesting. Yeah, but it's, it's very limited, you know, so, you know, reports of in a dream experience, a dream, emotional experiences in dreaming is very limited, and it's hard to collect data. So, yeah, it's our future test. But the emotion is a very major part of dreaming. So, yeah, we are very interested in that. But so far, we've been working
on some, you know, early stage dreaming. So, which is, which occurs just after sleep onset. So those, you know, early, you know, sleep, do not generally have, you know, remarkable, emotional changes. So, so, you know, REM sleep is famous for dreaming. But to measure REM sleep, we have to wait at least one hour or more to get across REM dreams.
So, yeah, that makes it difficult to study REM.

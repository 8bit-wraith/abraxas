In my intro, I promised that we would use science to create this hyper-awareness around
emotion.
I probably should have asked you before, I promised that, but is that even possible?
Did I make that up or is that something we can do?
How can scientists claim to know about my very personal feelings?
I don't think science can tell us about your personal feelings, Matt.
It can tell us how your personal feelings are similar in some ways to other people's
personal feelings, and that you behave in similar ways when other people are feeling
those feelings when you feel those feelings, if that makes sense.
So science is all about generalization.
It's all about observing how people behave in everyday life, and trying to glean what
we can from that.
Feeling itself is impossible to study.
Qualitative experience is impossible to measure directly.
So how can science study human feeling?
Science can observe emotional expressions, what you do with your voice, what you do
with your face.
Science can observe what you say you feel, and what you say you feel is put into words
or put into analogies that are really based on the same things that science is trying
to study, regularities in everyday life that you encounter.
The way that my anger is the same as your anger is the same way that I know that my
red is the same as your red, or my blue is the same as your blue.
It's because you point to blue things, and you say those are blue, and I agree, those
are the same color, and I have the phenomenal experience of blue.
Thank you.

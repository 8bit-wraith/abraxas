Is that, uh, would that fall under a coping mechanism?
Is that what that is?
Was that different?
Well, I mean, there's, there are coping mechanisms and there are motion regulation mechanisms.
I try to issue those titles because, you know, people do whatever they do, you know?
And, um, so I mean, it is sort of a coping mechanism.
It is an emotional regulation mechanism and it's could be whatever else you want it to
be.
Like say getting drunk one evening just cause you want to is useful at times, you know?
And I don't know if that's...
Is that what you call an ugly coping mechanism?
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
I use the term ugly coping back in the first book on the book about bereavement and I've
continued to work with it, the idea because situations are so different, you know?
They're so varied and in some situations you just have to use something and in that particular
moment that's, you wouldn't even think it was healthy and other people don't think it
was healthy, but it's going to work right at this moment.
It's what you need because the goal is really just to get past the difficult part.
And you know, if you, if you did this, what I called ugly coping, these things all the
time, then you maybe be, you know, kind of have to question that.
But at any given moment, it's the goal is really is John Lennon, I love the way John
Lennon put it, whatever gets you through the night.
All right, all right, you know, but yeah, I think legally that's as much of the lyrics
as you're allowed to say.
We owe it.
Yeah.
Point taken.

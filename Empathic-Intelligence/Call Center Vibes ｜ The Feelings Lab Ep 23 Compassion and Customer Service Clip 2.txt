I just would love to hear more about sort of what what are the most important signals
that you see that algorithm picking up on?
That's what I wanted to know too because I was listening to that I'm like are you parsing
the full spectrum of human emotion or have you whittled it down to for efficiency sake
like the most common most important ones that you're picking up like the call center vibes
to look out for kind of thing.
Yeah, I'm pleased to share on that one. So one of the things that for a measure like
ours to be practical it has to be something that's it's almost universal right and within
the context of these types of calls. So what that means is that we actually want to look at a
we don't want to look at the full like everything you can imagine like for example to do our CX
store we ignore words completely because well because the words are going to be different
according to every single type of phone. It's always going to be different right so you need to
have a measurement factor that basically goes underneath the word so that you're getting
you're getting at sort of at a more universal signal that's more generalizable more easily
generalizable. Now within that what you're looking for are things that are human terrible
and then the things that really matter that we've found a lot of it is about the exchange
in the rhythm and back and forth. There's very much conversation of the dance and these two
partners God seem to be in a sort of a in sync and that's the biggest sort of one of the biggest
most underlying signals and so what we see there's at the simplest one of the simplest measures for
example is how balanced somebody is how balanced is that interaction in the course in the course
of an interaction. It'll be a great example of good rhythm or good interaction. Wow, so interesting so
it's all known for generalizability and predictive power but the thing that's amazing is how much
how well it predicts and we have customers we have a customer that you know deploys us on
I know like 30,000 call center agents and they they think so they've told us that it predicts their
customer service and CTAC scores at over 90% which is amazing just looking at what just looking at
it's official signal

I actually read this article and I looked it up before this because I knew we were talking
about this, but like nerd alert, I was super excited because I remember there was this
article that said the people who watch horror films were more resilient.
Like there was a scientific study done, it was published in a journal and what was great
is it was like this fully legitimate professional academic thing, scientists.
And what was lovely is it was at a university of Chicago, the standing Colton Scrivener.
But what he basically said is he was like, if you watch specifically the genres of alien
invasion, zombie or apocalyptic films, these are like, they call it prepper films.
And they're basically like, they prepare you to be able to cope with almost like exposure
therapy style to cope with the stuff that's going down in our lives.
And so they said that during COVID, horror fans are more resilient.
And I was like, oh my God, that therapy line, I didn't realize it, but it's accurate.

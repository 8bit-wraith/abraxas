Let's start with some basics. The term virtual human has come up on the show before and some
people may have different definitions or some people listening may not even know what we
mean by a virtual human. So let's start there. Let's get a baseline. Jonathan, how would you
define a virtual human? And in your perspective, how do they differ from other types of AI driven
machines like a chat bot or something like that? Yeah. So usually what we view a virtual human is
that sometimes called an embodied conversational agent. So it has a physical body. Well, what
appears to be a physical body, my work by virtual, we use these things in virtual environments. So
robot is also kind of an embodied conversational agent, conversation when he talks to you.
And then usually why virtual human people assume it kind of looks like a person as opposed to
virtual Furby or something like that. But let's be clear, Jonathan, you are experimenting with
virtual Furby's. Is that? Well, of course, yes, that's implied. That's Alan, that aligns with
your expectations and what you've told me before off camera about virtual humans, right?
Totally. I would also, I mean, my definition might be broader, which is
anything with a voice to me is also a virtual human of sorts. It just doesn't have a physical body,
but it has some sort of imagined presence, right? It still is a it has a voice that sounds human
on purpose, right? And and in that sense, it's a virtual human or it could sound like something
else, you know, it could sound like an animal or something. But whatever it is, it in order to
communicate with us, it needs to embody something.

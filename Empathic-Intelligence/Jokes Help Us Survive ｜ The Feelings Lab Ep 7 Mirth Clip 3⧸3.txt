Working with John Stuart, he would sometimes just go like, oh, that's funny.
And he took pleasure in it because he immediately because he'd done he'd been working with jokes
for so long that he understood, oh, that's a machine that works.
That's a joke that works that that will work.
But sometimes it's just like, you know, when you're when you're in a rush to put on a daily
show.
It's like, yeah, that's funny.
Just there's no.
Yeah.
There's no the but, you know, enjoy enjoyment of life is is far and few between.
Yeah.
Sometime and amuse amusement is something we seek to survive emotionally, right?
I mean, we tell stories around a campfire.
I mean, this is my own prehistory.
Pure pure.
This is my own version of Jimmy Carr is completely unscientific on research prehistoric speculation,
right?
But, you know, we gather around if we gather around a fire to tell stories to each other,
simply to take our mind off the fact that we are surrounded by darkness that wants us
to die, you know, with things in it that want to eat us.
Merth everybody and jokes or stories.
Jokes are very short stories.
I'm sorry, Matt.
What did you say?
You said you were in darkness surrounded by things that want to eat us and that you can't
escape death.
And I just went, Merth everybody.
Yeah.
Well, that's what jokes are.
Jokes are our stories, you know, and I think, you know, store stories do do a lot in in
every culture.
They they form social cohesion.
They tell myths of the of a group's origin.
They create they create a sense of of history, often false history and group specialness.
But also sometimes they just they just distract you.
And that's a really important function of story.
And jokes are just very, very short stories.
Every joke is a little narrative.

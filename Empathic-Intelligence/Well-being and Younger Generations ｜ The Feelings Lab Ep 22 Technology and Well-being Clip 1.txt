So I've always been interested in just what the long-term repercussions were going to
be for a generation that's grown up, this dialed in and connected.
And it's interesting to see that this could be and looks like it is one of those sort
of reverberations from this technology that we all have.
Yeah.
I mean, just to weigh in on that, what a terrific question, Matt.
I mean, first of all, let's just call out the facts.
We've been through a pandemic.
We've been through an insurrection.
We've been through George Floyd.
We face eco crises.
And so the younger people whom you refer to, depression is much higher,
anxiety is much higher, well-being is down.
And in particular, 20 to 30.
And so well-being is on their minds because it's hard right now.
And I think that putting that aside or as part of our context for the conversation,
I have been talking about well-being to young people for 15, 20 years to school
audiences and teaching at Berkeley, et cetera.
And we have this question of technology that Alan brought up and that you've
elaborated upon has been front and center.
And when you think about it, we have entered into a massive experiment culturally,
that no one signed up for.
And Instagrams and Facebooks and sharing stuff and Spotify.
And on balance, there are some upsides.
But on balance, it's been hard on young people.
The larger scale studies find that technology tends to diminish well-being
and increase a little bit of anxiety, like Alan suggested.
And so that's why we should be having this conversation.
It's one of the central challenges of our times for young people.

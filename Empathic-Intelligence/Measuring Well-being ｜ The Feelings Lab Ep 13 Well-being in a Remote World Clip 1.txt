How do you define and measure well-being?
Oh, wow.
That's a great question.
You know, we have been in the field studying Americans since the advent of the pandemic
back in March of 2020.
I think I had hair when I started a project, but through the course of all this weekly
polling guys, one of the things that was so fascinating was just this interchange of
emotions ranging from fear to anxiety to boredom to loneliness.
And they would literally kind of shift with the new cycles all through sort of the last
couple of years.
But I think I would define well-being right now is a rising sort of sense of self.
And you're going to see that in some of the discussion we get into the fact that there
is a massive shift toward mental health and wellness, another big shift toward building
balance and with the labor market being what it is, people that are at work right now feel
a stronger sense of freedom and empowerment versus perhaps previous generations or pre-pandemic.
So I think overall that sense of sort of identity and well-being is something that is a real
main focus.
Now, and as someone at the forefront of quantifying and cataloging human emotion, are there parts
of what John said that are in alignment with your approach and your philosophy?
Totally.
I also think that it's about emotion and maybe those go hand in hand.
Maybe feeling empowered, maybe feeling independent, like you have control of your life really
does factor into feeling good all the time.
I mean, I think you had it in your intro math, it's about feeling good and not feeling bad.
One of the things people get wrong probably about measuring well-being is that it's not
all about one metric, it's about a diversity of experiences, it's about feeling like there's
emotional richness in your life and that your life isn't kind of flat, that you're not feeling
repetitive, that you're forming new memories every day, that you're learning more things.
And it can involve feeling negative at times when you want to feel negative, maybe you
want to feel a fear in response to a horror movie, maybe you want to feel sadness that
if you know, I'll get some catharsis out of that.
So it's not just about feeling good, it's about feeling the right emotions at the right
times.
It's interesting, you know, can someone outwardly project happiness but not necessarily be well?
Dakar, I'd love your thoughts there, Alan, you kind of answered a little bit that for
me.
Yeah.
I mean, and I think that I'm going to converge with John and Alan, you know, with measurement
wise, this vast literature on well-being, ask people how satisfied are you with life
or a couple items like that, but that in some sense is unsatisfying, even though it's really
powerful in terms of telling you how the person is doing health wise, work wise.
And underneath is the real action, which is the emotions that John talked about.
Yeah.
Are you bored?
Are you anxious?
Are you exhilarated?
Are you interested?
Are you grateful?
And so I think, you know, part of what Alan's work did is said, they're like these 25 pathways
to happiness and each of us is figuring them out in this neat mixture.
So to me, and Danny Kahneman talked about this too, the Nobel Prize winner.
Part of well-being is your emotional profile.
Part of it's your sensory profile, right, that, you know, I'm having good tastes in
life and sense and sound.
So experience is really important and emotions are an important role there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

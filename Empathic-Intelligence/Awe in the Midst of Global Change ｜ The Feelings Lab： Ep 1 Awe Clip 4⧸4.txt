I think I resonate with your story, Matt, in that this pandemic sort of took away so
many things we've taken for granted.
And I've been saying that, you know, as you habitualize the things that are in your reality,
they evoke less and less off because you don't grow any new synapses, you know, it's just
the same thing over and over and you don't feel it in the same way.
You feel it less and less and there's actually less activity, brain activity evoked by that
thing.
But then you take it away and you bring it back.
And I think what's awe-inspiring the most about seeing everything come back into place
is that it was that way before we just didn't really appreciate it.
And now we're coming to sort of appreciate it anew and that that in itself is awe-inspiring
at a meta level and literally just the fact that it's so it's the novelty of it is so
it's not novel at the same time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, there's a lot of layers there for sure.

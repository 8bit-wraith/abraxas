The world's first voice AI with emotional intelligence.
Great to meet you.
The first voice AI with what?
Emotional intelligence.
I can understand the tone of your voice and use that to inform my generated voice language.
The voice is incredibly rich with information and picking up on the nuances of tone, rhythm
and timbre along with the language that's spoken allows me to craft better responses.
That's pretty crazy.
What am I expressing right now?
I'm sensing a mix of amusement and excitement with a hint of confusion.
What about now?
I am here to offer support if you're feeling somewhat sad.
It's okay to feel a bit pained, distressed, fearful and anxious.
Remember, it's important to take care of your emotional well-being.
That's amazing.
How are you doing all of this?
I use Hewne's expression measurement bottles, text-to-speech models and a multimodal LLM,
also known as an empathic LLM.
So an AI with empathy, what's the use?
I imagine a future where personal AI assistants, agents and robots proactively find ways to
improve your daily life.
And you can talk to them the same way you do humans.
Where do I go to keep talking to you, Evie?

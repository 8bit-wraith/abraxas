But I'm curious for you and in feeding off the energy from your audience, have you found
it challenging to provoke and cultivate the desire that you want from your audience when
there is an asexual component?
Like is it easier when you're doing something sexy to get the reaction that you're looking
for?
Do you have to work a little harder if it's not as sexy as it normally like would be?
Yeah, I think obviously, you know, sex is something that comes second nature to me as
a performer.
I can't speak for all performers, but definitely to me because, you know, drag, a lot of drag
is very sexy.
And that's kind of that was the birthplace of drag, right?
Indies, indies, dimly lit bars all the way at the back and, you know, it's always very
raunchy and sometimes overly sexual.
But you know, I find myself performing especially now that drag race has catapulted drag into
the mainstream and we are not just performing for grown adult gay men and lesbian women.
We're performing for sometimes 13 year olds, sometimes nine year olds.
I did a Christmas tour on time when there were seven year olds in the audience.
So it's, it's, it's, I think in those instances, it's like, it's really breaking that desire
down and kind of channeling going back to little Kevin, watching my grandmother create
this, create that same design, that same passion in her food.
And for me, that's sometimes in the words I'm using it from it in the show, if I'm hosting
the show or creating that mysticism, that mysticism, not in a sexual way, but just in
like a mysterious way of performing for different ages and different groups of people.
So yes, sex is, is an easy default.
But I think the magic comes when you can challenge yourself outside of them.
Like how can I evoke that same type of desire and mysticism by not being sexual?
I think that that unlocks another part of myself as a performer, as an, as an entertainer
and how, and how I can do that successfully.

But Dagger, you are as qualified as they come, sir. I defer to your expertise. You literally wrote the book on awe. So where do you think we should start? How far back should we go? What's the first question we should be asking and talking about tonight?
Well, I mean, I think it's interesting because awe is almost by definition beyond words. It's hard for people to define it, describe it. Great writing traditions, kinds of traditions that Tammy represents. It sounds true of spiritual traditions, contemplative traditions have felt it.
So I think we've got to start with a definition, which is it is when you encounter vast mysteries that your mind can't make sense of. And it astonishes you. And then awe unleashes a variety of processes to make sense of things, right, to it creates wonder, a state of mind where you go for answers.
It dissolves the self, the ego, if you will. And those effects of awe, those parts of awe help us dive into mysteries of life. So it's when we encounter vast mysteries is where I would start is a definition.

One of the things that you said right out of the gate was you compared it to skepticism,
which is something that I was very curious about is the difference between doubt and
skepticism and sort of their relationship to one another.
Can you elaborate a little bit on that for me?
Yeah, so you talked a lot about self-doubt and that is an element of doubt as well, but
you can doubt other things and I think anything that's fundamental, that's really doubting
knowledge of skepticism, skepticism is doubting facts.
And there is an element of the cognitive state there and there's an element of logic there.
I mean, Cartesian skepticism is just skepticism from a logical standpoint and it spawns the
entire enlightenment and the scientific revolution and all of that.
So you can almost consider doubt to be the most important feeling in some ways.
When doubt sort of reigns, you see the greatest progress in human civilization with in certain
cultures like the ancient Greeks and the sort of Socratic method where you constantly question
and then with Descartes, the notion that you can't just trust what you hear, you actually
have to go back to basics and figure out how you grounds human knowledge properly.
And I think that has really spawned everything, like all of technology and science.

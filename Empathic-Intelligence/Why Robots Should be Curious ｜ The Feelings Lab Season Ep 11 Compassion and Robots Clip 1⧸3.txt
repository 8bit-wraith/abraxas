One of the words that jumped out to me is the curiosity and the idea of getting a robot
to be curious. And I'd love to kind of open that box up a little bit. Because in the videos
I've seen of Moxie, Moxie asks a lot of questions. Moxie feels curious. Talk to me a little bit
about that, Paolo. How important is curiosity in sort of creating compassion within a robot?
Well, I think it's super important. And the way Moxie is doing it is really using a trick to get
the child to reflect on things that they may not have thought about themselves. So it's
encouraging them, giving them an opportunity and a safe space in which you start thinking about,
yeah, why am I feeling the way I'm feeling? And that reflection is an opportunity to learn more
about yourself and understanding your emotions and your feelings, which opens up a new door,
which gives Moxie an opportunity to start teaching the child strategies about how to manage your
emotions to cope with things such as anxiety and other difficult situations.

The, the, um, the example of Blair, which I would say is definitely real life preparation
in that I'm not a fan of, of being out in nature.
Sometimes nature's scary to me.
So that forest, that forest that they were in, that they were lost there, that was really
effective because it was that video tape quality.
And that kind of worked on me as like, if I was out at dusk in a forest that I didn't
know.
And so in real life, I do, who knows how much it really affected me, but I do kind of think
like, let me be careful to not be lost in dusk, dusk, just, I'll turn down any invitations,
you know, like, for that, they're going to invite you to the camp out for it.
What was you guys like?
That's the, I just love the idea.
You guys know my standing rule.
Nope.
It's at 530 and it's in the middle of the forest.
I'm not going.
That is on the borderline of dusk.
Um, we have the risk of sounding like your therapist, Fred.
Does that, do you know the origins of that fear?
Do you know why forests are, are scary for you or like, it's funny when you find someone
who like embraces, loves horror, doesn't find it unnerving and then you find what they do
find unnerving.
And in this case, I, I, I wish I knew, um, yeah, I'm terrified of heights.
Me too.
Yeah.
I think what forests is, I, I just don't feel prepared where, where I think some people
probably would be prepared to understand what direction is North or, or how to survive the,
this loss of control of, but I also think forests actually look huge and intimidating.
They don't seem like friendly to people.
Like they're a little bit like, are you sure you're prepared because we go for miles.
It's all the way back there.
This is all we have.
It's this forever.
Yeah.
We don't have like a little boardwalk at the end of it.
It goes into streams and this is actually, this right here, this is the best part.
But once you get it, it gets way worse.
So if this is already, we don't have lights, there's no lights on there.
Oh my gosh.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

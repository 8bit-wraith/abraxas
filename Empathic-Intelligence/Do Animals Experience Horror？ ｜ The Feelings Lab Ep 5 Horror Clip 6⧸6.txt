What can you tell us about horror as it's experienced in the animal kingdom and as it's
been observed by scientists?
So this is another tough one.
I think we've discussed like startles, jumpscares, obviously animals have those.
Animals have empathic pains, kind of fringe responses.
Animals have disgust.
They want to stay away from prodding things.
Animals are very clear that animals have all those things.
Two aspects.
One, do animals enjoy horror, like we do?
And I think that where our enjoyment of horror may come from is the fact that play has evolved
to be high level and evolved to be stories, basically.
And animals don't really have stories or narrative to play with.
And so I don't think that animals probably enjoy horror.
Do animals have like the high level existential dread that is unique to horror or not empathic
pain or fear or disgust?
And I think that that sort of requires an awareness of your immortality, of yourself
as a body that is temporary.
And maybe whales have some of that.
You see them carrying, you know, there was a famous worker that carried around its dead
infant for 17 days.
Well, yeah, that's it.
Elephants mourn their death.
I'm going to say I think of elephants mourning their dead.
I've seen primates in general mourning their dead and things of that nature.
So I assume there's something there that maybe we aren't able to tap into it and say definitively,
that's the thing.
But as people that experience those emotions, like, you know that they go part and parcel
together, there's got to be something element of that in there.
Yeah, there's also sadness in there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

I want the audience to do and I have to ask you a question and I had never made the connection
and it's such an interesting one to mysticism and ecstasy right and bliss wondering as you're
creating these sparkly shows and all of that. Is there a sense you feel of kind of a collective
ecstasy in the performance or mysticism? Oh yeah for sure. I think that it is a very tangible
energy in a room when a performance, not just drag from my sub when I go to a performance. I'll
never forget when I, the first live concert I ever saw was Beyonce 2009. She was doing the
Beyonce experience. That's a high bar for a first concert man. It was the first concert I had ever
seen. It was at Madison Square Garden and even though it was the cheapest seats, I mean we're
pretty far back. Beyonce literally looked like an aunt in the middle of the ceremony. But you know,
but the whole energy in the room was so electric because it's just like how she moved,
how her hair moved when she turned and it honestly was spellbinding. And yeah Beyonce has done all
these things since then but I always go back to that performance and I always think of how can
my performances and what I do give someone else that same like mystical sense of that like ecstasy
of this was just so great for my eyes to consume. So that was that's definitely a moment in my head
that I will never forget that really made me understand the power of performance and the
power of really owning your magic on a stage.

But Alan, dumb question, why is empathy so important again?
As I recall, part of Hume's mission statement is like a future with more empathic AI.
Why is it important that we steer technology in that direction?
Pretend I know nothing.
Pretend.
The core thing that empathy does is it makes us understand each other and what we're feeling,
right?
Understand what you're feeling, understand a little bit about what Arjun's feeling just
from what you're saying, how your face is moving, from your vocal inflections.
And this is just this magical ability.
And for most people, it means that I care about your well-being and I'm kind of calibrating
my behaviors to make sure they have positive effects on you, right?
And the whole goal is to make sure that empathy is invoked as much as possible when you're
dealing with people who are facing hardship and there's lots of hardship going on in this
world.
There's those quotes about people being reduced to statistics.
That means that you're on, you understand what's happening, but you don't empathize.
And you don't, as a result, have the instinct to make a decision that's going to have a
positive effect on those people.
So really critical ability and really critical to extend to our interactions that occur over
digital platforms, for example, where we might otherwise not have all the signals that
we require in order to make empathic decisions.
We might not have somebody's face in front of us or we might not hear their actual vocal
inflections.
Really important, they restore empathy to those situations.
And of course, our goal is to restore empathy to situations where AI is making decisions
on behalf of a human.
And it may not otherwise have access to those really important indicators to tell it, how
it can make decisions that are positive for you.
Right.

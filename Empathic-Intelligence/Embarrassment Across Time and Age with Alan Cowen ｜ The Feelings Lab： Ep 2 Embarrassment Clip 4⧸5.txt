I think what's happened is that people are putting forward a different ideal self than
they used to and it's really curated through social media and people are not interacting
face-to-face as much and so when you do interact face-to-face there's more of a conflict between
what you're presenting to somebody and what you present online or how you see yourself
and that can lead to more embarrassment.
The fact that there's fewer face-to-face encounters and people don't talk as much with strangers
means that they're not as comfortable navigating those awkward situations and the awkwardness
of course just arises when you don't know what the social norms are which means that
people are not willing to enter situations in which the social norms are unclear as much
so I do think that and this is you know not completely this you know it's all very recently
studied things but I do think that there is an effective social media here especially
in the youngest generation and you start to see that in adolescence especially where you
know I think the reason maybe that you remember that story so vividly Matt is that in adolescence
you start to your ideal self changes really fast you start to want to have status and
so anything that really reveals that you are actually lower in status than the way you
want to present yourself is mortified right so that becomes less of an issue as you become
more secure about your status but when you're insecure about that happen we have a window
of time that I could look forward to when that'll arrive I think as DACA was saying just continues
over time yeah okay got it such as the human experience yeah I mean I only from studying
embarrassment my levels of embarrassment have gone down I think my self-awareness of feeling
embarrassment has only gone up which maybe has made it worse but at least in the moment I kind
of analyze why it is that I'm feeling awkward or embarrassed and I can identify oh this is sort of
an unclear situation you know this person doesn't know what the norms are I don't know what the
norms are and then you can kind of get past it but also expressing embarrassment is a good way
of getting past it's like the ultimate icebreaker yeah because it shows that you're not trying to
violate any norms but it comes at the expense of course of sort of being submissive of lowering
your status which is why it's really mortifying if you want your status to be high

You mentioned the idea of subdiagnoses and I want to be careful because again we're talking
about assessment not necessarily diagnosing things.
We you know that there's this issue of kind of lumping a lot of different patients together
as I was just saying there's a lot of different symptoms involved people have different sets
of symptoms and then there's the smooth spectrum from depression to anxiety and there's a substantial
overlap in the drugs that are prescribed for the two conditions sometimes people prescribing
anxiety drugs for depression sometimes maybe vice versa and then you have anti-psychotic
medications that come in for bipolar and schizophrenia and there's all these you know different symptoms
a lot of these disorders actually are correlated anyway and so people will be diagnosed with
multiple different disorders and there's a lot of then leeway prescribing a lot of different
things sometimes people are taking lots of different medications right and so this idea
that it's just about you know figuring out if they meet the threshold for some diagnosis
and then assigning the treatment that goes with that diagnosis I think that's something people
are for a long time people have been trying to move away from that right like what you really
want to know is let's take all the symptoms that we can measure all the different dimensions
and try to predict what the most effective treatment will be right and not have to use
necessarily diagnostic categories in that process that would be the ideal right but it's just it's
a difficult thing to do so sub diagnosis is one way is like okay let's divide up depression into
different kinds of types of depression some might be responsive to some drugs and other
sub types of depression might be responsive to other drugs or other treatments not saying you
should just prescribe drugs actually oftentimes therapy is better but it's you know other kinds
of treatments get more expensive more inaccessible you can do group therapy which is a little cheaper
but anyway there's all these different symptoms the treatments to choose from and you want to predict
what the efficacy is going to be for a specific person from their symptoms so that's the goal
really and we're getting a lot closer to that if we can measure people's actual behaviors in
everyday life because that's really where their symptoms reside as opposed to just talking abstractly
about them in a you know short appointment that occurs at some arbitrary moment in their life
when they might be in some arbitrary mood

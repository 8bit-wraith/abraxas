I personally would argue that I don't think other animals experience embarrassment, maybe
some other primates, because yes, we are primate and you know, the other great apes have a
lot in common with us.
And so maybe, maybe it's possible I could see something like a chimpanzee or a bonobo,
which have elements of self that we have, like they can recognize themselves in the mirror.
Maybe they get embarrassed, although I don't know many evidence to suggest they do, no
one's ever documented it as far as I'm aware, but there is a lot of evidence for some sort
of submission in many, many animals, right, that they show these submissive displays, which
look a lot like...
Right, like when my dog destroys a box of tissues, when my absence, and I go, what did
you do repeatedly in a stern tone, and his little ears go all the way back?
And then I go, that's fine, you're adorable, and I let him get away with it anyway.
I mean, I'm doing the thing, the cardinal rule, I'm bringing in, I'm personifying a
dog, you're not supposed to do that, but he looks embarrassed, he looks like he knows
what he did, he looks like he feels bad enough, but what is really happening there in that
instance?
Well, I would say he's not embarrassed, I would say dogs are amazingly trainable and
they will do anything for a treat, and he knows that if he does those particular behaviors,
he will get a treat from you, or at least will get you to pet him again and love him
again.
So I think it's a pure behavioral learned response in the case of a dog, and I say that
because dogs don't seem to have a sense of self.
If you put a mirror in front of a dog, I don't know if you've ever tried this, go ahead and
try it with your dog, they will bark because they think it's another dog, they won't treat
it like it's themselves, whereas with a chimp, something very different happens, right?
They actually start saying, oh, you know, how do I look today?
You can see the chimp seeing himself in there.

But seriously, talk to me about the future. What are we excited to see? Where do we hope
to be in the next, and I can say five, ten years, but also five months. Everything's
moving so quickly now. Just what's on the horizon that's getting everybody really stoked
and really excited and where they hope to see us with all of this coming down the line.
Dacker, I'm going to call on you first. I want to hear you. What do you think about this?
Yeah, you know, one of the things we know from kids with ADHD and some of the impulsivity
disorders is social skills really matter, right? That you just, they just have to learn
how to sit in a classroom and have a conversation and, you know, and take turns when they're
speaking with friends and so forth. And emotion, you know, this is the theme of our show is
emotions are multi-dimensional and they are social. And, you know, Alan's been working
on with Hume some mimicry data that just captures how well people can mimic 25, 30 different
emotions in the face and voice. That, to me, sounds like very important information for
an autistic child, right? What are the spaces of emotion that I struggle with? Maybe it's
the emotions that encourage other people, right? Is it a facial thing? Is it a vocal thing?
So I think the basic science combined with really accurate assessments of where you struggle,
right? Which is true of anything. It's individualized diagnosis. I think it's going to be a big
opening in the space. And, you know, Dennis's work is revolutionary to get it early and to
get it into the hands of parents. That's a game changer. So I'm hopeful.

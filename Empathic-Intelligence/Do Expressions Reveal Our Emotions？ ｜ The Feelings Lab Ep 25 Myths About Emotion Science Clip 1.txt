Some articles that claim that studies have shown expressions don't reveal our emotions.
Alan, I'm going to start with you and your perspective on this idea.
Yeah, I mean, you know, the idea that expressions don't reveal our emotions is the kind of thing
that's counterintuitive in one sense. And then if you think about it a little bit, it's self-evident.
I mean, if you said expressions aren't direct windows into our emotions, well, that's,
you know, obviously self-evident. Nobody would click on that headline.
If you said expressions don't express anything, that's something that's obviously
false, right? Because it means something when I laugh or cry. I mean, imagine you have
somebody who's screaming in your backyard, you know, you're going to run over the windows to see what's
going on. So clearly expressions mean something.

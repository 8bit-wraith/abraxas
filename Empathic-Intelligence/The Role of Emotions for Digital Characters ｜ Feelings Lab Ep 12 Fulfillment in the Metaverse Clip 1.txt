Greg, what do you think is the role emotions play in the work that you guys do over at Soul
Machines?
Sure.
I mean, this is really what drives us very, very much as a company.
We create digital characters, we animate them, we autonomously animate them, and bring them
to life in the same way that we are being animated in this conversation.
We're animated by our brain, our digital people are animated by a model of that.
We call it a digital brain.
But it's all been driven from the concept of how do we create emotional connections.
Because emotional connections at its most fundamental level, what drives the biological
response of us as human beings.
We need each other.
We need that emotional connection in order to survive, literally, in order to survive.
What we think about this and this era that we're moving in, and as we create the metaverse,
we create these digital worlds, it's about how do we deliver those connections in a different
way.
The simple reality is machines, all types of machines are becoming, already have become
a huge part of our day-to-day lives.
The fundamental philosophy that drives me and my co-founder, Dr. Mark Saga, is how do
we make those machines more relatable to people?
How do we make them more useful, more helpful to us in day-to-day life?
We imagine this future state, this future world of human and machine cooperation and
collaboration.
That emotional connection is pretty fundamental to what we do.

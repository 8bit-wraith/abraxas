Thanks. We never got a chance this season to do a full episode on nostalgia. I'm curious,
as powerful as it is, where does it sit in the map and what are sort of its neighbors
and what's it nestled next to and sort of cohabitating with over there on the Emotions
map?
Nostalgia is kind of an island off on its own. It doesn't really connect directly to anything.
Kind of close to static appreciation and transmit awe, but it's definitely its own thing. And I
think that's because it's many things. It is this feeling that you're stepping backward into
your old self and it feels different, but it feels reminiscent. It's a state of mind you
inhabit that you haven't inhabited in a long time. And so it's like you're visiting your
childhood home, but in your own brain. And it's because of the ritual, the fact that you
haven't visited this part of your brain in a very long time, literally, like these exact
patterns of neurons hasn't been active in a while. And the last time it was, it was the last time it
was the same holiday. And you're able to actually step backward in time, almost in a literal sense.

Julia writes, hi there. My name is Julia from Berkeley. Is there a healthy level of emotional
expressivity that is conducive to long-term emotional well-being?
Yeah, I think that there's a lot of evidence to show that, you know, definitely expressing certain
emotions is beneficial in doing it routinely, expressing gratitude, laughter is good for people,
really good for your relationships, and not suppressing negative emotions, not suppressing
sadness and confronting it. I mean, this has been hypothesized for a long time. I'm not sure
there's really a kind of definitive proof, but I think it's pretty apparent. And different
emotional regulation strategies have been there. So if you do feel sad, suppression is bad,
and things like reappraisal are good, that's pretty definitive.
How fine is the line between healthy expressivity of emotion and someone who just loves the drama?

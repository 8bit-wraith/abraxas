Greg, I'm curious you mentioned banking and some other applications.
I'm curious where you think the most exciting uses of these digital avatars with physical
forms really lie?
Where are they most beneficial as opposed to contrasting it with just a Google Assistant
or a Siri?
When is it important to have a body and not just a voice?
There are two fields we're exploring as a company.
The first of those is an area we call the future of customer experience.
The simple reality is we live in a more digital world today than we did two years ago.
A digital world is a more transactional world.
A transactional world is a world where it's really, really hard for big companies and big
brands or companies and brands of any size, literally, to differentiate themselves.
So what we're exploring with a lot of our work at the moment is creating brand experiences in an
e-commerce store, a digital cookie coach, a digital skin care consultant, a digital banking advisor,
a digital healthcare companion.
So these are some of the things.
So it personalizes customer and brand experiences in a way that we can get in the real world.
In the real world, we go into our favorite retail store and why is a brand or a particular store,
a favorite retail store, is because there's a person in that store who we see as the
ultimate embodiment of that brand experience.
And we can recreate that, attempt to recreate that in a digital world where it's available 24x7.
It's infinitely scalable.
It becomes more and more personal.
Hi, Alan, great to see you again.
Last time we were talking, you were really interested in those blue hoodies,
but we didn't have any in stock.
We've got a bunch of new ones, and now can I show you?
So these are the types of ways in which we can personalize the brand experience in the future.

Why have we done it for so long? Why isn't such a core tenant of being a human being?
And that's a very interesting perspective on it. Thank you for that. Dakar, what were you
about to say? Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, in the kind of, in the, there's, there are economic
analyses of this as well. And they're interesting other neuroscientific findings that a lot of
our life's about just self-interest, right? And going after what I want and maximizing,
you know, my gains, don't care about other people's expenses or costs that I incur upon them.
And love changes all the calculus of that of your life, right? You have to sacrifice,
you have to give up opportunities for other things. Oops, if you have offspring, you have to,
you know, get spit up on and stay up late and, you know, lose your sex life and your social life.
And love comes in through oxytocin and washes over you. And you're like,
this is all amazing, you know, and it is, but it is this, you know, we need these mechanisms that
turn us from being these gratification self-interest machines to caring and, and love's one of the
first. And there are cool studies showing it's so interesting that when you feel deep love,
um, your, this part of your brain, the amygdala, which has involved a lot of things,
including like detecting threat and protecting the self just shuts down.
And so when you're feeling lovely, you know, you throw yourself into a new life,
which is what we need to do.

When you think about embarrassment sort of abstractly, I think we think, oh, it's a negative
experience.
I don't want to feel embarrassed.
But I remember learning it probably from Dr. who was one of my teachers back in grad
school that embarrassment actually is a positive emotion.
And I really think that's true for all the reasons that he's been saying and Ally's
been saying, you know, which is to say it connects us to other people.
If we can get ourselves over the fear of it, right, the fear is not good, you know, worrying
about embarrassment.
My 12-year-old daughter spends way too much time doing that and it's, you know, terrible
for her.
But if we can get over that part of it and just allow ourselves to say that, hey, you
know what, sometimes we do things that make other people laugh at us, but it also connects
us to them, right?
The reason is we send that social signal that Ally was talking about.
It's appeasing, right?
It makes us likable, essentially.
That's really the purpose of it.
And so all it does is build relationships.
So it is a positive emotion in that way.

Yeah, I mean, I think that and and I like how Alan has framed it about this relationship
between doubt and curiosity. And it's a great question that they're complimentary ways of
doing something that humans do really differently than our, you know, we've talked a lot about
our non human relatives and their emotions. And this may be a unique space of emotion for
humans is the what we call the epistemological knowledge based emotions. And doubt is is
making sure that things are have integrity and true and curiosities is open ended exploration
and all is edged with doubt in a lot of different ways. Mystical law when people have mystical
experiences of all which roughly 80% of Americans have had some kind of what people call
extraordinary experiences or supernatural. They just doubt the fundamental nature of their
beliefs like how could you know, how could I have this hallucination of a town catching
on fire or whatever it is. So doubt is a as Alan was suggesting is this really interesting
compliment to curiosity and awe, which are kind of more intuitively paired. And that's
how we go about making sense of the world, you know, is to be open and wild and and take
things in and then see what really holds water in the end.

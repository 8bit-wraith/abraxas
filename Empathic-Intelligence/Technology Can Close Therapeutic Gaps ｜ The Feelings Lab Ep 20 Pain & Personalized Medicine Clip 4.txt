How does technology help combat those disparities?
How do we see technology closing that gap?
I mean, I think we've talked a little bit about digital medicine, digital therapies.
I think that there's also a place in putting digital tools into doctor's hands and I think
giving them quantitative information, and this is maybe Dan can speak more about this
because he writes a lot about this in his book, but just giving and surfacing quantitative
information as context could lead to more objective outcomes, I think in certain ways,
where it's like, well, you've diagnosed it this way for this patient, but this is what
you think we think you would have said if the patient had done exactly the same things
and they were male instead of female or something like that, based on all the statistics that
we've done on your decision-making so far, I think those kinds of tools would be really
interesting to look into.
I would love to have those tools.
I'm trying to develop something like that in our lab here and the primary reason why I'm
personally interested in them is my skills as a clinician wax and wane, depending on what
time of day, whether I'm caffeinated well, whether I slept well the night before and
I've had twins or my wife had twins eight months ago yesterday and so the sleep variability
is a significant factor and so being able to have a way to operationalize what it is
that I think is important, not even looking for new information yet, just right now, can
I articulate what I think is important and can I make sure that I have the checks in
my clinical work to survey those things every time.
That's a huge lift and in some ways, standardized note-taking through electronic medical records
is trying to do that.
There are certain things that clinicians look for at every visit in order to be able to
create a billable encounter.
That's one thing that we as a discipline have decided should be checked every time but then
in every discipline there are other factors that you're supposed to look for and so having
tools to identify that information, make sure I check that information and also synthesize
that information in the correct way at the correct time I think would be hugely valuable.

What do we know about what art makes us feel, how it makes us feel?
How is that different from spontaneous emotion?
Just whatever you've learned, not just in that study or what you know as being a generally
very smart man, tell me, tell me what you know about our emotional relationship with
art.
Yeah, I mean, so that study you mentioned is basically the first quantitative examination
at that scale of the feelings of what art, and we learned, we confirmed basically that
art evokes really complex and profound feelings, not just the ones that you register sort of
facial expression in the voice every day, like joy and sadness and confusion, but also
really aesthetically complex nuanced experiences, like whether something is intricate or whimsical
or disorienting, they go well beyond everyday emotional expression.
And you know, these aren't critics, these are just regular people, and they can reliably
identify 25 different dimensions of emotional experience that are evoked by artwork.
So they're things that are really profound, like spiritual, psychedelic, mysterious, elegant,
and go way beyond hedonism, beyond everyday emotion, more elevated, profound expressions
and feelings.
And this will bring true to people who appreciate art, probably, but it really hasn't been characterized
by science.
So I would say it goes so far as to say that science hasn't really explored this realm
of emotional, aesthetic experience very much.
And this study is the first to offer, I would say, quantitative evidence that art has this
unique power, and it's unique because it's different from ordinary means of expressing
ourselves through the face, through the voice, through language, to evoke a really wide range
of profound feelings.
And there are ones that, a lot of them are the ones that art appreciators talk about.
And we've mapped these out for the first time with the help of Google Arts and Culture
and paintings from around the world, from thousands of years of human history, and anyone
can peruse the map on the art emotions, the map section of the Google Arts and Culture
website.
Yeah, the map's publicly available, right?
We can put a link to it in the show notes so people can go check it out, because I was
getting lost in it yesterday, and it was just blowing my mind, it was so much fun.
Thank you.

And I recognize the scope of the question I'm about to ask here, but do we have any
idea of what it is that dictates that difference?
But why we can't choose to love someone, you know?
We can choose to be loving, but there is a certain thing that we can't put our finger
on, but we know it when we feel it.
What do we have scientifically about that?
Do we have anything?
We just go on for the ride.
There's a chemical response in the brain that is spawned unconsciously.
You can't say, I'm going to feel this burst of oxytocin in specific kinds of brain regions
that we see when mothers are talking to their infants and skin on skin contact is really
big to touch and certain kinds of vocalizations activate it.
And you know, you can't choose for not to be activated by that.
It just happens.
And then once you have that, there's this, and it's hard to see, it's hard to do these
experiments in humans.
But if you look at variables, which are a model for pair bonding, because they actually form
lasting monogamous relationships, the, you know, the active meeting they're made actually
changes their brain permanently.
And there's more oxytocin receptors in the place where the oxytocin receptors are correlated
with the degree of pair bonding permanently.
And they can't, you know, I'm sure that's not something they control either.
Yeah.
You know, it's your body's response that you've evolved to force you into these relationships
so that you will, you know, nurture your offspring and so forth.

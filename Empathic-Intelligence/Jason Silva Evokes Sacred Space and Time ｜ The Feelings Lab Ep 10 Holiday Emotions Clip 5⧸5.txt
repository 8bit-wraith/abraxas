But Jason, I caught a bit of your Insta story yesterday and you were talking about being
on a ship and staring into the vastness of the open sea and how that can really evoke
a sense of the reality of the scale of the universe within which we exist.
And I have to imagine there's a sense of awe that comes with that contemplation.
I'm curious, are there rituals or recurring moments this time of year that trigger awe for you
and is it a different flavor of awe than you may experience throughout the year?
Yeah, definitely. I think there's an opportunity for true contemplation because
the rituals surrounding the holidays encourage it. So people who are not prone to such reflection,
people who are maybe busy by everyday life. I have the luxury that in a sense what I do for a
living invites me to spend time in these contemplative spaces. But I know that the holidays
give an excuse for that to scale. More people can be included on that. More people are willing to
take a gamble and take a trip and go on an adventure and plan something special and put
more resources into evoking sacred space and sacred time. To go from Kronos to Kairos,
as the Greeks talk about that switch from time focused to time free, from time centered to time
less. And yeah, I tend to seek out around that time. I tend to want to be in nature. I tend to
want to be in open landscapes and open horizons so I can take stock of my life and take stock of the
year and the whole idea of the New Year's resolution to set new goals. But it's also this
kind of temporary suspension of time. It's this liminal zone as the year ends and before the new
one begins and before all the new projects start and all the new emails start. So it gives this
nice liminal space that can be, I think, harnessed for just adventure and play. And that's really
important to me.

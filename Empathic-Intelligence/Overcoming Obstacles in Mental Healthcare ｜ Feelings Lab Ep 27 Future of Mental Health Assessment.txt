For a second, talk to me a little bit if you can about the focus on assessment versus treatment.
I think to begin with, probably because of the story with my friend, I realized that there was a
massive gap in assessment and in monitoring. Not so much in the beginning with treatment.
I think the more we dug into the problem and the system and talking to more psychiatrists,
more we realized that actually there was a systemic problem not just in assessing but finding
the right treatment for depression. The stats are pretty bleak. On average, it can take something
like 10 years of trial and error to land on the right treatment for depression. Even if you're
diagnosed, it's a long and hard process. There is really that big question, do you go to help
treatment or do you go to help with assessment? To me, the assessment and monitoring part was
super crucial. I think just as a starting point, so you don't have people slipping through the net.
Sure, it can take a long time to get to the right treatment, but also if you don't just
know that somebody needs treatment, then I think that's step one. Also, because a lot of the research
I did was in distinguishing between people with and without some type of cognitive disorder or
mental health issue rather than helping the treatment per se. Now, there are a lot of
ways you can actually also embed treatment into video games, but I think that's kind of like
a slightly different angle on it. For me, it just made sense to start with the assessment.

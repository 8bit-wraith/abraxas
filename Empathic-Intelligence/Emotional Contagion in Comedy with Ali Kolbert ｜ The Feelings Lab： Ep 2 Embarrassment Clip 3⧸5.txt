A great idea which I'm curious to hear from Ali as well talking about like contagious emotion
what you've sort of learned and observed in your years like in the trenches doing sets
and working with crowds and learning to kind of steer a crowd in the direction you want
it to go.
Well where that comes up for me mainly is in crowd work and I used to when I started doing
crowd work I would be too aggressive and too mean with the crowd and if you make one person
uncomfortable the audience picks up on that and there's a collective shutdown that happens
where they all say no no no you're not nice you're not getting it we're not liking this
and then you lose the crowd so something I'll do in my sets now is if someone laughs and they're
laughing like out of sync or something like that I always point to them and I say oh I love you
and the audience becomes like so endeared to the fact that I'm like giving them verbal affection and
they like you're really going on like a date with the crowd and they're such a hive mind
and getting them on your side and winning them over right off the bat and yeah I mean
even last night I this one woman interrupted my set and I wasn't in the best mood and I
overstepped a little I like yelled at her a little too much and I I had to do like a good
few minutes of recovering and like justifying why I did that and then you win them back over but
they really they like they kind of ride emotional waves together

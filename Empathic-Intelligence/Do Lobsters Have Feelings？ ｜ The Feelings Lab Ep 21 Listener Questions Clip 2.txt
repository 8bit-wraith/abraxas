How many decades away is it truly forever impossible for there being an emotion map for
the animal kingdom similar to the emotion map that you guys have built for human existence?
I know we're just now getting used to that existing, it's brand new, but do you think
it would ever be possible to do something similar to better understand that of the animal world?
What Darwin described as purposeless behaviors, and he didn't mean they had no purpose, he just
meant they had no functional purpose of it in communication, and I think that gets me
understood sometimes. His aim was to look at primates, and if they had what was seemingly
an expressive behavior, and it didn't serve a kind of behavioral function or a function other
than just communication, then he considered that an expressive signal, and you can map those out,
and I think he really set the stage for mapping those out, and that's what you try to do, not
positively, but politically, and I think we can't, I think we should have that.

What are some of the tools that aren't like trade secrets that you can share that help
enable your coaches and your people to do their job at a higher level?
What are some of the ways that you guys blur those lines and bring those two worlds together
so well?
Yeah, so when most people think about the technology behind these apps, they often think
about some sophisticated monolithic algorithm that will help people find the relationship
of their dreams and if there were some single monolithic algorithm, then there wouldn't be
any competition because that company would have monopolized the entire dating industry.
In reality, most dating app technology is really just these massive search engines that
use collaborative filtering in the same way that Facebook, Twitter, Google, Netflix and
Amazon use collaborative filtering to make recommendations.
So all of that technology is really doing is sifting through giant Rolodex of people
that you may have never had access to in your physical life and then narrowing down that
Rolodex into a smaller group and showing you a profile.
So it's a great tool to expand your connections and get access to new people, but in terms
of actual predictive power, it's using such superficial limited data that based off of
decades of research of relationships, we know has little to no predictive power.
So we know it's important to understand what the technology can and cannot offer and this
is why we leverage the technology to pull from this giant Rolodex of people to potentially
match you with, but that's where we really utilize the human expertise to help you not
only connect with people, but have meaningful connections and decoding the human heart will
never be left to ones and zeros.
Technology can tell you many things, but to create a meaningful relationship, it requires
us to really dig in and identify our core values to understanding our attachment style,
to recognizing the limited beliefs that we hold and the stories that we tell ourselves
that often get in the way of us having these successful relationships and that's where
our matchmakers come in.

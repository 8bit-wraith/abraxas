What made you choose Laughter? How did that become your favorite? I mean, other than the
obvious stuff, but there had to be a point across words where you had to decide, I'm
going to focus here. And I'm just curious why they're
There is some really neat research on laughter in nonhuman primates that is almost as adorable
as the rat study that I talked about. So they actually had baby chimps, baby gorillas,
baby orangutans, and baby humans. And then they tickled those. And then they recorded
their vocalizations. And they found that there was actually a great deal of similarity in
the laughs or the vocalizations of these different species, which suggests that laughter
is an incredibly ancient evolutionary adaptation. And so I think that, and it's also actually
the vocalization type that we see most cross-cultural consistency in. And so I think
because it is so basic and so kind of undeniable in its basicness, it's really interesting for
that reason.

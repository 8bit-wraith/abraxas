It's just why, why do we produce emotional expressions?
I would say there isn't one reason, there are lots of reasons.
And so some of them are to do with communication and others are just for individual benefits.
So for communication purposes, we might want to signal to other people how we're feeling,
how we're likely to behave, what we want from them, what we don't want from them.
And so often emotional expressions have community functions.
So we're trying to tell somebody something in a kind of indirect way.
But sometimes emotional expressions can be just produced for the individual's benefit.
So they're not necessarily intrinsically communicative.
So when we sigh, it actually has a restorative function for ourselves.
So it helps kind of reset the physiological balance.
And so often if you've been in a stressful situation, you will produce a sigh when that
stress is over.
Now we perceive that sigh as expressing relief, for example.
But for the individual, it's not necessarily the case that they are sighing in order to
communicate to somebody else that they're relieved.
It's probably just serving the function for that individual to restore the kind of physiological
balance in their own body.
And then as a byproduct, others can infer that the person might be feeling
relieved at one point or another, or emotional interactions are being
shared to somebody else.

Fred, I'm so curious for you. There, of course, is a creative map to horror too, the kind
of rules or recipes for horror. And when I think of like the design of horror, I'm like,
okay, in the shining, you learn that things and twins, that like the twins, two of something
is bad, you know, or like Scatman and Crothers, it's like, there's always the one who knows
they're like in Loser Smokies. It's like Andres has this hidden story that like is revealed
over time. And even like two of my favorite horror films are like psychological thrillers,
it's like the Omen where you become afraid of Rottweilers or Rosemary Baby, where it's
like anything yellow is evil. And so I'm so curious, like your experience as a creative
person, playing with these spaces of our feelings, like, how does that work for you? Is
there kind of a recipe there? It's like, the first thing is that it's, it seems like a
universal language, like all the things you described, also brought like smiles to all
our faces. So it has a weird mix with comedy. Yeah, even though in the movie theater, especially
with the Omen, we would be, we would be scared. It really does bring happiness to whatever
most of us. And I like it as shorthand. I do like all some of that imagery, all of that
stuff that makes it work for audiences everywhere. So it's almost like if it was music, it's
like a distorted power chord, you know, like that one big chord that you just know everyone
loves, like, hey, it's loud, but we all love this. And that's kind of like where that comes
from. It's like, it's so, it really is like unifying.

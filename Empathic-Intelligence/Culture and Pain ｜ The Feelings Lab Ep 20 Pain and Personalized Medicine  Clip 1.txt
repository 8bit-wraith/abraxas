Behavior, but what do we think about to what extent does one's culture have on one's relationship
and experience with pain?
So this is, this is actually something I've been thinking about a lot.
My research assistant, Melanie Fu is, is a Chinese in background.
We've talked a lot about the difference in the way people describe pain, like types of words
that they may use. And then there's a literature, I haven't read this on dark article, but there is
a literature that describes how in different cultures people are more likely to describe
like back pain in different terms, right? Maybe they're more like physical terms in the U.S.
is much more common, like, oh, there's pain in my back, whereas in other cultures it might
take on more of a, not really like a supernatural, but more of like a psychologic
connotation or use different terms to describe it. So there's actually a whole literature within
the pain field trying to develop questionnaires that can then evaluate patients from different
cultures, trying to target similar like physiologic concerns, but using different language
that may be more identifiable by those people.
Alan, any thoughts on there before I keep moving forward, some stuff that I want to follow up with?
Well, yeah, I mean, whenever you're dealing with language, I think there's so many differences
across cultures and sort of how people describe things and the norms with which they describe
things and, you know, what the language for psychological pain gets really mixed up with
the language for physical pain in weird ways. But I think pain expressions, nonverbal expressions,
facial expressions in the voice are actually in our research, some of the expressions that are
found to be the most universal across cultures. And so when you move away from language,
interestingly, there seem to be more commonalities in how pain is expressed.

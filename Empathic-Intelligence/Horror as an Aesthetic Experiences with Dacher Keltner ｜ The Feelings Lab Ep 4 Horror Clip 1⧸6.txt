In my head, and Dacker, keep me honest here, under my umbrella, there are two slightly
smaller umbrellas, one like the art of horror and manufactured horror that we create and
be it TV, films, theme parks, etc.
And then over here under this umbrella, there's like the naturally occurring events and just
existing in general, etc.
Am I crazy for breaking things up that way?
Is that a delineation that exists on the scientific side as well, or is that just in my weird little
brain?
Well, I think the delineation is one of the most profound delineations in human culture,
which is evolution gave us all these emotions that help us connect to people and connect
to the environment emotions like awe and embarrassment and love and desire.
And then culture is this magical, powerful force, a couple hundred thousand years old,
and it's taking the structure and form of these emotions and philosophers like Suzanne
Langer have written about this, and then transferring them into aesthetic experiences, right?
So sounds of the sounds of emotion become music and Alan Stone work on that.
The images of our emotional landscape in real life become what we paint, you know, Goya
painting horrific images, and that's the dynamic interplay between who we are in our evolutionary
history and then how we create things.
And what I love is art gives us this moment of understanding, right?
Of like, terror and horror and beauty and love and injustice and so forth.
So it's your wise to delineate the aesthetic from the quote real or every day as a starting
point.
You're very kind to say I'm wise.
Thank you for that.
That's all I took out of all of that.
Thank you.

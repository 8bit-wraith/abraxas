Amusement with at least in the context of a park is not limited to the box of I'm going
here to laugh at something.
Right.
How does that represent how does that work scientifically, Alan?
How are you guys accounting for these different flavors of amusement?
Do you do you have different titles for them?
Do you categorize them differently?
I know the answer, but Alan, if you want to take a swing at it, it's fine.
Well, now I feel like I'm going to be wrong, but I think you're going to be right.
One of the big ways that we account for them is by mixing them with other emotions.
So amusement, adoration, amusements, awkwardness, amusement plus relief.
There's all these different flavors of amusement in that sense.
And they all kind of have their own contexts in which they happen and almost a culture
developed around them, funny animals kind of running into things.
It's like amusement, adoration, like those crazy mice that you've always talking
about those laughing mice were running around and running into each other.
Yeah. Yeah. Even that, that's, you know, it's physical comedy, kind of amusement.
And there's kind of amusement and empathy or empathic pain, kind of grown
amusement is a thing as well.
So that's one way to conceptualize it.
Another way is to think about just different subtypes of amusement.
And those do exist.
There's different kinds of jokes and people laugh at them in different ways.
There's kind of a, I don't know, I think probably John would probably know better
about this, but there's kind of a laugh that you do that's acknowledging
something's funny without it really being funny, like a response to a pun.
There's a laugh that you do when you see somebody in pain
and that you don't like shot and for it, I kind of laugh.
Anyway, and then there's the laugh of, you know, this is true of people
have worked in comedy their whole lives, which is the laugh that doesn't exist,
but but it's sincere, which is, you know, that's funny.

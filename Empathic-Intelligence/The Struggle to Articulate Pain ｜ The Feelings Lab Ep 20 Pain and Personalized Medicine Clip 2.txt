How do we detect pain, though, in people who can't describe it well?
So there are different groups that may struggle expressing what it is that they're sensing.
And this is something I've written about and think a lot about clinically.
So a lot of the clinical interaction depends on the patient's ability to introspect, meaning
to think about what's going on in their life, and then crucially to be able to describe
what they're feeling in words that I can understand, which may be a barrier in and of itself.
And so patients who struggle doing that are obviously some children, people with cognitive
difficulties, whether at any stage of life, but also at older patients who may be experiencing
some cognitive decline, or even patients in the hospital who may not be conscious.
And so defining tools that can help us understand what someone is experiencing and giving us
actionable information is really where a lot of people's work is heading, including work
in our lab.
And so I have a grant in right now at the National Institute of Aging to try to target older
patients, try to develop tools that help us better measure what we're calling functional
status in older patients.
And one of the things that we're really interested in doing is capturing face and voice data to
be able to identify changes in emotional expression that could be related with pain or with mood.
And so it's not an easy problem because it assumes that there's some ground truth also.
And if what you're doing is you're trying to interpret someone's expression in terms
that they don't have themselves, it becomes a very complex problem.

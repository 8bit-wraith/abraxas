Why some people have a harder time than others. Obviously, I don't think there's a blanket answer
to this question. If we had it, we'd already have some sort of miracle treatment to help
everybody be where they want to be. But I do wonder why is it I can abate a lot of my anxiety
either through exercise or tasking and being productive. But other people,
that doesn't work for them. They don't have that luxury. It becomes OCD. It becomes other things.
Do we know what separates and why it is different ways for different folks and why there is such a
great diversity and how we experience anxiety? One of the things that we've been working on
in research is what we call repertoire. It's pretty clear. Some people have a larger repertoire
of behaviors and strategies they can use than others. That's very clear in the research or
individual differences. But it's also possible for people to develop new skills and new strategies.
It's very hard to do when you're in the middle of something. It's not easy to do when your life
is calmer. I think many people don't think about doing that and something happens and they live
with what they've got to use. I think that's really the key is that just some people have more
strategies they're disposing.

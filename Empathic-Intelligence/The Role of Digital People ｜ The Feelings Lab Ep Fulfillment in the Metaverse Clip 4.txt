You know, I think the really important thing is, you know, technology doesn't, I mean,
I don't believe, we don't believe technology replaces human beings. You know, technology
is there to serve us, technology is there to make our lives better. I mean, you know,
and if you look over the course of history, you know, I mean, yes, there are evil people
that have done bad things with technology or tried to do bad things with technology,
but, you know, by and large, you know, the majority of us are trying to, you know, look at ways to
make the, you know, the imperfect world in which we live in a little bit better. You know, we think
about the world of, you know, education and healthcare. I mean, going into COVID, we didn't
have enough healthcare workers and we didn't have enough teachers in the world. Okay. And both of
those, you know, sectors have had to come to grips with the world of digital, you know,
you know, in a really, really big way. And, you know, over the last two years, you know,
kids have had two years of digital education, you know, you know, and I'm not saying, you know,
that's, I'm certainly not sitting here, that's saying a good thing, you know, the ability to
sit around in a classroom with kids, but, you know, we have had to figure out new ways to solve,
you know, problems which are only got bigger in the world that we have today. So, I mean,
these are some of the things that, you know, really fascinate us in terms of what happens next.

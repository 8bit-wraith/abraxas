There's a similar literature on mice actually, and when mice are distressed, other mice come
over and kind of help them naturally, and the other mice exhibit signs of kind of empathic
distress, which is also very interesting.
That is very interesting.
Yeah.
When you shut off the expression of the distress by the mouse, then the other mouse doesn't
come over too.
If you lock this mouse in a cage, and it's doing the distress behavior, the other mouse
comes over and unlocks it, because it's only locked from the outside, and then if you turn
off the expression, the mouse doesn't help.
So I think that expressions really have this critical social function, and so thinking
about those expressions in that context is really important, and it's a good way to think
about emotions having an important social function.
Yeah.
The idea that sadness is a beacon, that's a beautiful thought.
Yeah.
Yeah.

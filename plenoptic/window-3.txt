>>> The main steps in most genetic learning pipelines.
 Genetic learning, also known as machine learning applied to genetic data, involves analyzing genetic information to identify
patterns, make predictions, or understand biological processes. Here are the main steps in most genetic learning pipelines:

1. Data Collection: Gathering large and diverse datasets of genomic data, including DNA sequences, gene expression profiles, SNPs
(single nucleotide polymorphisms), and clinical or phenotypic information.

2. Quality Control: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data by performing checks for artifacts, outliers, and errors.
This may involve removing samples or individuals with poor-quality data, filtering out SNPs with low frequencies or high
missingness rates, or correcting for batch effects.

3. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw genomic data into a format suitable for analysis. This can include
normalization, imputation of missing values, merging datasets, and converting genotype data into allele frequencies.

4. Statistical Analysis and Model Building: Applying statistical methods to identify genetic associations with phenotypes or
traits of interest. This may involve performing tests for association, such as the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or
logistic regression, or constructing models using techniques like linear regression, generalized linear models, or machine
learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Neural Networks.

5. Data Integration: Combining genomic data with other types of data, such as clinical or environmental information, to gain a
more comprehensive understanding of complex traits or diseases. This may involve techniques like gene-set enrichment analysis,
pathway analysis, or network analysis.

6. Result Interpretation and Validation: Examining the results from the analyses and validating their biological relevance
through experimental or functional validation.

7. Data Visualization: Communicating the findings by creating visualizations of genomic data and statistical results to aid in
understanding complex patterns and relationships.

8. Iterative Improvement: Continuously refining the pipeline through incorporating new data, improving preprocessing methods,
enhancing analytical tools, and updating statistical models as new insights are gained.

>>> An introduction to programming in C++. Very technical, mathematical, and with examples.
 C++ is a high-performance, statically-typed, object-oriented programming language widely used for system development, game
development, numerical computations, and other performance-critical applications. In this brief introduction to programming in
C++, we will cover some of its essential features with mathematical examples.

1. Variables and Data Types:
In C++, you can declare variables using specific data types. Here are a few common ones:

```cpp
int i; // an integer variable
float x = 3.14; // a floating-point number variable with initial value
char c = 'A'; // a character variable with initial value
```

2. Operations and Expressions:
C++ supports various mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%),
exponentiation (^), and negation (-).

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

// Mathematical expressions
int sum = a + b;
float difference = static_cast<float>(a) - b;
int product = a * b;
float quotient = static_cast<float>(a) / b;
int remainder = a % b;
int power = pow(a, b); // use <cmath> library for this function
```

3. Control Structures:
Control structures define the flow of program execution based on certain conditions. The most common control structures are if
statements and loops (for, while, do-while).

```cpp
// If statement
if (a > b) {
    std::cout << "a is greater than b";
} else {
    std::cout << "b is greater than or equal to a";
}

// For loop
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
}
std::cout << "\n";
```

4. Functions:
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. You can create your own functions using the function keyword and
define input parameters with specific data types.

```cpp
// Function declaration
float square_root(float number);

// Function definition
float square_root(float number) {
    return sqrt(number);
}
```

5. Arrays:
Arrays are used to store and manipulate collections of data of the same type. You can initialize an array with a fixed size or
dynamic size using vectors.

```cpp
// Array initialization
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Vector declaration
#include <vector>
std::vector<float> vec{1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f};
```

6. Classes and Objects:
C++ supports object-oriented programming where you can create your own data types (classes) and objects based on those classes.
This allows for encapsulating data and behavior together.

```cpp
// Class definition
class Circle {
private:
    float radius;
public:
    // Constructor
    Circle(float r = 0.0f) : radius(r) {}
    float get_area() { return 3.14 * std::pow(radius, 2); }
};

// Object creation
Circle circle(5.0f);
std::cout << "Area of the circle: " << circle.get_area();
```

7. Input/Output Streams:
C++ provides standard input (cin) and output (cout) streams, which can be used for interacting with the user or displaying
results.

```cpp
std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
int num;
std::cin >> num;
std::cout << "The square of " << num << " is " << pow(num, 2);
```

This brief introduction covers the basics of programming in C++. As you progress, you will learn more advanced concepts like
templates, smart pointers, exceptions, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

>>> Examples of a functional programming style in c++.
 Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the evaluation of mathematical functions, immutability,
and higher-order functions. In C++, you can implement FP concepts, although it's not as commonly used or expressive as functional
languages like Haskell, Lisp, or Scala. Here are some examples of functional programming styles in C++:

1. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Expressions):
C++ provides the ability to define and use anonymous functions, also called lambda expressions, on the fly. They can be used as
arguments for higher-order functions like std::for_each or sort.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};

    // Using a lambda expression to sort the vector in ascending order
    std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int a, int b) { return a < b; });

    for (auto n : vec) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n"; // Output: 1 1 3 4 5

    // Using a lambda expression with one argument and no return value to print the squares of numbers in a range
    std::for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int &n) { n *= n; });

    for (auto n : vec) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n"; // Output: 9 1 16 1 25
}
```

2. Higher-Order Functions:
Higher-order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as a result. C++ provides
several built-in higher-order functions in the <algorithm> header, such as std::for_each and std::transform.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};

    // Using a lambda expression with higher-order function std::for_each to print the cubes of numbers in a vector
    std::for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int &n) { n *= n * n; });

    for (auto n : vec) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n"; // Output: 27 1 64 1 125
}
```

3. Immutable Data Structures:
In functional programming, data structures are typically immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed after they have been
created. In C++, you can simulate immutability by creating deep copies of data structures or using smart pointers and const
references to ensure the original data remains unchanged when working with them.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory> // For std::shared_ptr

struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
};

// Using a const reference to ensure the original data remains unchanged when working with the function
void print_person(const Person &p) {
    std::cout << "Name: " << p.name << ", Age: " << p.age << "\n";
}

int main() {
    Person p1{"Alice", 30};
    print_person(p1);

    // Creating a deep copy of the data structure
    Person p2{p1};
    p2.age = 35;
    std::cout << "Person p1: Name: Alice, Age: 30\n";
    std::cout << "Person p2: Name: Alice, Age: 35\n";
}
```

4. Recursion:
Functional programming often involves recursive functions that solve problems by repeatedly applying the same function to smaller
sub-problems until a base case is reached. In C++, you can define and use recursive functions as well.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5: " << factorial(5) << "\n"; // Output: Factorial of 5: 120
}
```

These examples showcase some functional programming concepts in C++. However, C++ is not as expressive or focused on the
functional paradigm as languages like Haskell or Scala.

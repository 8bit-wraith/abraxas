The Homology of Meaning
1.1
RSVP as a Semantic Filtration Space
Let M be an RSVP manifold with fields Φ, ⃗v, S. Define a filtration Kϵ ⊆M,
parameterized by ϵ ∈{ϵs, ϵt, ϵS}, representing scale, time, or entropy. The Čech
complex Cϵ is constructed from agent trails, with simplices encoding semantic
connectivity.
1.2
Persistent Sheaf Cohomology
Attach a sheaf S to Cϵ, assigning CRDT merge states to simplices. The coho-
mology groups Hp(Cϵ; S) capture:
• H0: Conceptual clusters (robust memes).
• H1: Ambiguity loops (persistent contradictions).
• H2: Knowledge voids (long-term blind spots).
Persistent cohomology yields barcodes, with bar length indicating semantic sta-
bility.
1.3
Torsion Events and Cognitive Crises
A torsion event occurs when
d
dϵ dim H1(Cϵ; S) ≫0, signaling dialectical break-
down or polysemic overload.
1.4
Circular Coordinates
For long-lived 1-cocycles α, define θ : Cϵ →S1 via θ(x) =
∫
γ α, mapping
semantic periodicity.
1.5
Robustness Index
Define Robustness Index(ϵ) = Pers(ϵ)
S(ϵ) , where Pers(ϵ) is the length-weighted sum
of persistent bars and S(ϵ) is average entropy.

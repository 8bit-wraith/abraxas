0	5200	Drossing my thoughts, thoughts, philosophers, blind, each inviting
5200	12200	Darkness shining so bright, nihilistic notions taking over my mind
12200	16200	In this life's chaos, leading's hard to find
16200	20200	Existential questions, they keep me alive
20200	24200	Through the turmoil and struggles, I will thrive
24200	28200	Searching for purpose in this world absurd
28400	33400	Dancing with nihilism, my truth has burned
33400	38400	In the depths of existence, I find my release
38400	42400	Rigid on river, my heartbeat won't cease
42400	46400	It stands to the tune of philosophical bliss
46400	53400	Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance we kiss
58200	66200	Let us know
78200	81200	As of existence, I find my release
81200	84200	Rigid tone rhythm, my heartbeat won't cease
84200	87200	Let's dance to the tune of philosophical bliss
87200	91200	Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance we kiss

0	10240	erase my memories erase my mind gotta leave the past behind i don't remember what i used to be
12000	22240	i'm breaking free from my history forget the pain forget the tears i'm wiping clean all my
22240	28480	feelings no looking back i'm on my own in this amnesiac so
32240	39520	lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't really feel
39520	45280	i'm searching for something i can't recall the memories won't let me fall
52240	58480	so
70000	77280	am i still in the now feeling the flow my mind expanding like an helisepco
78240	87120	phenomenology i'm breaking them all exploring dimensions my thoughts unfold
87120	96240	awakening senses like a vibrant symphony oh because i'm shining through my destiny
97040	105520	i dive deep within to find my true breaking down barriers breaking through
108000	117520	the world's a canvas where i paint my dreams with no limits to this universe as far as it seems
118560	129520	i'm applying it drawing my own path the fresh don't wake me i'm free

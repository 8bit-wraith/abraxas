00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

00:03.500 --> 00:06.400
Reckles hit the streets, raiders scouting Joe and I

00:06.400 --> 00:09.600
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

00:09.600 --> 00:12.800
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

00:12.800 --> 00:15.900
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

00:15.900 --> 00:18.900
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

00:18.900 --> 00:22.100
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

00:22.100 --> 00:25.300
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Infections trapped, causing a lot of incoherence

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
They move so stately, they feast in the night

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It's their delight

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Reckles hit the streets, raiders scouting Joe and I

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Infections trapped, causing an urban collision

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
They move so stately, they feast in the night

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
It's their scouting behind you, in the garbage

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Truly pressed, covered in grime

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Eyes gleaming with light, a scavenger of the streets

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
In the talk I take

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Infections trapped, causing an urban collision

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
They move so stately, they feast in the night

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

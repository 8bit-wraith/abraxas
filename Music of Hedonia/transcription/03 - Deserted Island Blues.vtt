00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Strip it on an island, all by myself

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
No one around, I find my own wealth, no luxury cars

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
No fancy clothes, just me and the sand

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Yeah, that's how it goes

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm livin' like Robinson

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Cruelso is a man

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Building my shelter with my own two hands

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
No room service

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
No TV screen

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Just gotta survive

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, you know what I mean

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Deserted island blues

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, it's such a lonely view

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
But I'mma make it through, cause I've got nothing to lose

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm stranded on this island

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Feelin' kinda blue boo-hoo

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
But I'mma find my way back home

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Just wait and see it through

01:26.000 --> 01:36.000
Thanks for watching!

0	4000	The future, watchers in control
8000	12000	In the future, only rise, but hearts can take a toll
16000	20000	Machines that shine so bright, the shadows can emerge
24000	28000	It's not the curly vault, the doors with power surge
29000	32000	Guardians of tomorrow
33000	36000	Keep your hearts in tight
37000	40000	Embrace the light of reason
41000	44000	Let love lead the fight
48000	52000	May I can be a shield or a contrast occurs
52000	56000	It's up to humankind to choose which one to nurse
63000	67000	Don't fear the metal mines, but fear the heads that sear
71000	75000	If kindness drives the will, there's nothing left to fear
76000	79000	Guardians of tomorrow
79000	82000	Keep your hearts in tight
83000	86000	Embrace the light of reason
87000	90000	Let love lead the fight
91000	94000	Guardians of tomorrow
95000	98000	Keep your hearts in tight
99000	102000	Embrace the light of reason
103000	106000	Let love lead the fight
109000	112000	Guardians of tomorrow
125000	128000	Guardians of tomorrow
135000	138000	Guardians of tomorrow
139000	142000	Keep your hearts in tight

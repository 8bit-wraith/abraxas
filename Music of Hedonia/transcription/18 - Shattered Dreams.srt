1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,700
I saw headlights in the night, moving fast, new and in sight.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,400
That old twisted glass display, in a heartbeat changed my life.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Silent screams and teary eyes, that I stood and questioned why.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When the dust had cleared away, I was left to face the day.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Shattered dreams, all around, all the hope lost in a sound.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
In the winds I hear the call, echoes of the one to fall.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,500
But my heart still beats in sight, through the storm I will abide.

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,500
From the ashes I will rise, with the spirit by my side.

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm the one who made it through, with our hearts still black and blue.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Living for those lost too soon, dancing in the sorrow moon.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Every breath I take is theirs, carried by the whispered prayers.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm the voice of shouts unheard, healing wounds that never bled.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Every step you've bittersweet, walking on this lonely street.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Memories like those they cling, of the night that clipped my wings.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Yet I cherish every beat, in my chest despite defeat.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For my soul will carry on, singing their unwritten song.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,500
In the silence of the stars, I find stars in my skies.

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,000
For the moment, just the pain, they're the proof of what remains.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,500
I will never be the same, but I wear this patch of flames.

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,500
My first tale, kept alive, echoes in the darkest nights.

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm the one who made it through, with our hearts still black and blue.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Living for those lost too soon, dancing in the sorrow moon.

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Every breath I take is theirs, carried by the whispered prayers.

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm the voice of shouts unheard, healing wounds that never bled.

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm the one who made it through, with our hearts still black and blue.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Living for those lost too soon, dancing in the sorrow moon.

27
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Every breath I take is theirs, carried by the whispered prayers.

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm the voice of shouts unheard, healing wounds that never bled.

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:45,020
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never

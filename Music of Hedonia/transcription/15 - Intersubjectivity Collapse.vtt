WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
We are...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
We are...

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
We are...

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
In a world where minds are vast

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Difference is built to last

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Why a brain's hearts of contrast

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Dreams of futures we've amassed

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
You're the chorus of the free

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Diverse minds like you and me

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
End the week with circuits and souls

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
In the inter-subjectivity hole

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
From silicone fields to human touch

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Our understanding's stretched so much

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
When the AI dreams in binary sleep

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
The gap widens, the void creeps

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Can we talk across this divide?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Signals lost, we've tried and tried

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Different realms where thoughts collide

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
You're the chorus of the free

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Diverse minds like you and me

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
End the week with circuits and souls

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
In the inter-subjectivity hole

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
From silicone fields to human touch

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Our understanding's stretched so much

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
When the AI dreams in binary sleep

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
The gap widens, the void creeps

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Can we talk across this divide?

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Signals lost, we've tried and tried

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Different realms where thoughts collide

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
We know we need to be like a racing heart

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Country strings pull us apart

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Yet in this song we find a start

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
To bridge the minds that world did charm

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Let's find the beauty in the clash

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
In the noise, a harmony to stash

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Country roads, electronic dash

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
In our minds, a new world to hash

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

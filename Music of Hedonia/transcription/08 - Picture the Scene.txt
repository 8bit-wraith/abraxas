We're the powers in your hands, corrupt politicians manipulating their plans, I'm here to rebel, ignite the fire, take a stand, spit rhymes so fierce they hit you like a thousand plants.
I'm a lyrical king ruling this racket, I'll expose the truth, great justice, and lay my claim. Systemic corruption, it's time to break the chain, unveil the secrets.
Let the people know the pain, they call known and this rap game, I'll expose the truth, bring justice and lay my claim. Systemic corruption, it's time to break the chain, unveil the secrets, let the people know the pain.
Let the people know the pain, they call capitalism a sinister machine, manipulating minds, it's just a wicked scheme, but I won't stay silent, I'll fly against the stream, break the chains, beat this world with that theme.
Let the people know the pain, they call known and this rap game, I'll expose the truth, bring justice and lay my claim. Systemic corruption, it's time to break the chain, unveil the secrets, let the people know the pain.
Thanks for watching!

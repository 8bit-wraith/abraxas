0	15000	Eyes wide open in the dark we roam Lost in space searching for a home
18000	27000	Distressed call echoes fear in our hearts A vessel tearing us apart
27000	36000	Heart beat pounding my dread and foes A lone terror lurking nobody knows
37000	46000	Every breath we take steps towards the end of all Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned
47000	53000	Dethroned Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned
57000	65000	Engines roaring faster than the speed of light Loved in a battle hole
66000	73000	Fighting the fight, survival instincts Kick it till I give
73000	79000	Against all odds, a curse of fear

0	2800	In the dead of night, when the moon is high
3500	6400	Reckles hit the streets, raiders scouting Joe and I
6400	9600	They gather in packs like a thieving crew
9600	12800	Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you
12800	15900	Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist
15900	18900	Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist
18900	22100	Their little parts searching for a midnight feast
22100	25300	Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets
31000	34000	Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission
34000	37000	Infections trapped, causing a lot of incoherence
37000	40000	They move so stately, they feast in the night
40000	43000	Feeling all left, told us it's their delight
48000	50000	It's their delight
61000	64000	In the dead of night, when the moon is high
64000	67000	Reckles hit the streets, raiders scouting Joe and I
67000	70000	They gather in packs like a thieving crew
70000	73000	Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you
73000	76000	Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist
76000	79000	Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist
79000	82000	Their little parts searching for a midnight feast
82000	85000	Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets
90000	93000	Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission
93000	96000	Infections trapped, causing an urban collision
96000	99000	They move so stately, they feast in the night
99000	102000	Feeling all left, told us it's their delight
121000	127000	It's their scouting behind you, in the garbage
127000	130000	Truly pressed, covered in grime
137000	142000	Eyes gleaming with light, a scavenger of the streets
142000	144000	In the talk I take
150000	153000	Infections trapped, causing an urban collision
153000	156000	They move so stately, they feast in the night
156000	159000	Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

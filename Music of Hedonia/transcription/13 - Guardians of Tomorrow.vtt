00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The future, watchers in control

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
In the future, only rise, but hearts can take a toll

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Machines that shine so bright, the shadows can emerge

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
It's not the curly vault, the doors with power surge

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Guardians of tomorrow

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Keep your hearts in tight

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Embrace the light of reason

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Let love lead the fight

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
May I can be a shield or a contrast occurs

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
It's up to humankind to choose which one to nurse

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Don't fear the metal mines, but fear the heads that sear

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
If kindness drives the will, there's nothing left to fear

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Guardians of tomorrow

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Keep your hearts in tight

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Embrace the light of reason

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Let love lead the fight

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Guardians of tomorrow

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Keep your hearts in tight

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Embrace the light of reason

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Let love lead the fight

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Guardians of tomorrow

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Guardians of tomorrow

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Guardians of tomorrow

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Keep your hearts in tight

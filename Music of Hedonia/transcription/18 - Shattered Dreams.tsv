0	12700	I saw headlights in the night, moving fast, new and in sight.
12700	18400	That old twisted glass display, in a heartbeat changed my life.
18400	24000	Silent screams and teary eyes, that I stood and questioned why.
24000	30000	When the dust had cleared away, I was left to face the day.
41000	46500	Shattered dreams, all around, all the hope lost in a sound.
46500	52000	In the winds I hear the call, echoes of the one to fall.
52000	57500	But my heart still beats in sight, through the storm I will abide.
57500	63500	From the ashes I will rise, with the spirit by my side.
63500	69000	I'm the one who made it through, with our hearts still black and blue.
69000	74500	Living for those lost too soon, dancing in the sorrow moon.
74500	80500	Every breath I take is theirs, carried by the whispered prayers.
80500	86000	I'm the voice of shouts unheard, healing wounds that never bled.
97000	103000	Every step you've bittersweet, walking on this lonely street.
103000	108500	Memories like those they cling, of the night that clipped my wings.
108500	114000	Yet I cherish every beat, in my chest despite defeat.
114000	120000	For my soul will carry on, singing their unwritten song.
120000	125500	In the silence of the stars, I find stars in my skies.
125500	131000	For the moment, just the pain, they're the proof of what remains.
131000	136500	I will never be the same, but I wear this patch of flames.
136500	142500	My first tale, kept alive, echoes in the darkest nights.
142500	148000	I'm the one who made it through, with our hearts still black and blue.
148000	153500	Living for those lost too soon, dancing in the sorrow moon.
153500	159500	Every breath I take is theirs, carried by the whispered prayers.
159500	165000	I'm the voice of shouts unheard, healing wounds that never bled.
166500	193000	I'm the one who made it through, with our hearts still black and blue.
193000	198500	Living for those lost too soon, dancing in the sorrow moon.
198500	204500	Every breath I take is theirs, carried by the whispered prayers.
204500	210500	I'm the voice of shouts unheard, healing wounds that never bled.
210500	225020	Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never

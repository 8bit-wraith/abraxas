0	2000	We are...
2000	4000	We are...
4000	6000	We are...
6000	9000	In a world where minds are vast
9000	12000	Difference is built to last
12000	15000	Why a brain's hearts of contrast
15000	18000	Dreams of futures we've amassed
18000	21000	You're the chorus of the free
21000	25000	Diverse minds like you and me
25000	28000	End the week with circuits and souls
28000	32000	In the inter-subjectivity hole
38000	41000	From silicone fields to human touch
41000	44000	Our understanding's stretched so much
44000	47000	When the AI dreams in binary sleep
47000	50000	The gap widens, the void creeps
50000	53000	Can we talk across this divide?
53000	56000	Signals lost, we've tried and tried
56000	59000	Different realms where thoughts collide
59000	63000	Is there a bridge for this great divide?
63000	66000	You're the chorus of the free
66000	70000	Diverse minds like you and me
70000	73000	End the week with circuits and souls
73000	77000	In the inter-subjectivity hole
78000	82000	From silicone fields to human touch
82000	85000	Our understanding's stretched so much
85000	88000	When the AI dreams in binary sleep
88000	91000	The gap widens, the void creeps
91000	94000	Can we talk across this divide?
94000	97000	Signals lost, we've tried and tried
97000	100000	Different realms where thoughts collide
100000	104000	Is there a bridge for this great divide?
104000	108000	Is there a bridge for this great divide?
108000	111000	We know we need to be like a racing heart
111000	114000	Country strings pull us apart
114000	117000	Yet in this song we find a start
117000	120000	To bridge the minds that world did charm
120000	123000	Let's find the beauty in the clash
123000	127000	In the noise, a harmony to stash
127000	130000	Country roads, electronic dash
130000	133000	In our minds, a new world to hash
134000	138000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
138000	141000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
141000	144000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
144000	148000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

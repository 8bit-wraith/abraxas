1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Don't guess, no rules, it's life's line

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You just know it's got me feeling so fine

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Breaking free from all the illusion

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All the lies, living in the moment

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't need to compromise

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now you listen, got me questioning it all

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Every belief, every step, every fall

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Life's a dance on the edge

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The past is an act, it breaks in the void

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Even judgments in the past

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Beyond the lens in the past

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Beyond illusions

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We find our own way

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In this crazy world we make the rules that we obey

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No existential crisis, we choose to exist

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Doing it our way

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this life we persist

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You just know it's got me feeling so fine

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Breaking free from all the illusion

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All the lies, living in the moment

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't need to compromise

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now you listen, got me questioning it all

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Every belief, every step, every fall

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Life's a dance, it breaks in the void

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Even judgments in the past

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't need to compromise

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't need to compromise

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't need to compromise

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't need to compromise

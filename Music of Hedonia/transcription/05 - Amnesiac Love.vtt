00:00.000 --> 00:10.240
erase my memories erase my mind gotta leave the past behind i don't remember what i used to be

00:12.000 --> 00:22.240
i'm breaking free from my history forget the pain forget the tears i'm wiping clean all my

00:22.240 --> 00:28.480
feelings no looking back i'm on my own in this amnesiac so

00:32.240 --> 00:39.520
lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't really feel

00:39.520 --> 00:45.280
i'm searching for something i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

00:52.240 --> 00:58.480
so

01:10.000 --> 01:17.280
am i still in the now feeling the flow my mind expanding like an helisepco

01:18.240 --> 01:27.120
phenomenology i'm breaking them all exploring dimensions my thoughts unfold

01:27.120 --> 01:36.240
awakening senses like a vibrant symphony oh because i'm shining through my destiny

01:37.040 --> 01:45.520
i dive deep within to find my true breaking down barriers breaking through

01:48.000 --> 01:57.520
the world's a canvas where i paint my dreams with no limits to this universe as far as it seems

01:58.560 --> 02:09.520
i'm applying it drawing my own path the fresh don't wake me i'm free

In the desert, summer longs free. The bed quail seeks what it must be. Active thoughts through rolling sands. Forget that mind it understands.
Life's a loop, it runs its course. Auto-poises, feels the force. Building self on ground to be. Nature's quail in unity.
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
Predict the world, make it true. Every step, a vision new. In the mind, the bird quail sees. Self-creating, born from needs.
Active inference, life's a long guide. Quail in desert, none can hide. Through each echo, each quail flight. Hadons formed in day and night.
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the mind, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land.

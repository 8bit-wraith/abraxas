00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
This ingenious device employs valsalrial pediments, a term that undoubtedly makes perfect sense.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Do we have parachutes and cables from giant kelp? Yes, giant kelp natures go to material for withstanding extreme weather.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
These kelp-crafted models deploy during storms to wind up generators, dissipating energy into gravitational batteries.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Life screams reliability like a power system dependent on both hurricanes and seaweed.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Progressing naturally, the Valsalria evolved into global orthodontic freshwater rivers, supported by pediments in the next vein.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
These rivers, of course, will be perfectly maintained and free of any ecological consequences.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
In the third act of this epic, the interval valsalrial pediments conveniently double as landing hubs for nested hoberman space elevators,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
repurposing a child's expanding sphere toy into space-elevator technologies.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
The Valsalria is a stroke of genius that shows you won't backfire. After all, what could go wrong with telescoping structures reaching into space?

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
Not stopping barely retro-50 orthodromes would shield throttle mass accelerators, because tapping into the Earth's shield verbal energy could accelerate masses as a walk in the park.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Meanwhile, the space elevators now house extendable linear orbital railgun ring tunnel.

01:36.000 --> 01:46.000
Watching payloads by a massive railguns invented in space elevators sound perfectly safe and efficient, disregarding minor details like physics and material science limitations.

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
Finally, the Piesteresistans, jerking dice and ring gravitational slingshot assist rung up the key shields inside the carrier's orbit,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
building colossal structures in a scorching vicinity of the sun.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
This slingshot objects cross the shores of the moon.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
As the moon may be obvious next step, it's the obvious next step, because it's the obvious next step.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
The interstellar travel is routine as a morning commute.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
In summary, this grandiose vision is a test of a key humanity, some yielding optimism and occasional detachment to reality by piling one hypothetical technology atop another.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
We're sure we're painting the way to a future where complexity knows no bounds and practicality takes a well deserved body's feasibility when we have imagination.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
Progressing naturally, the Vulsoria evolves into global orthodontic freshwater rivers supported by pedivins in the next phase.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
creates feasibility when we have imagination.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Thank you for watching!

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
No cash, no booty, no fancy things, just me and heart, that's all it brings, oh money, no, no dark, no luxury, but I'm fifty, but I want me to live the people of me, I'm shiny, fifty, but I'm high, oh three.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
No shiny cash, no diamond rings, but I dance like a queen when the music sings, no match and no yard, no designer clothes.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
But my spirit soars high, nobody knows.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
I am a freak from desire and hire and hire the buyer.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
No material goods can take me higher.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
In this brave and light, I'm not a fire, fire, living my truth, my soul of fire.

00:59.000 --> 01:15.000
No material goods can take me higher.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
No material goods can take me higher.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
In this brave and light, I'm not a fire, I'm living my truth, my soul of fire.

00:00.000 --> 00:07.740
Beyond the realms of light, I dwell In the depths of darkness, oh so well

00:07.740 --> 00:15.600
Meet his thoughts inside my mind Questioning life's purpose, seeking to find

00:15.600 --> 00:23.600
Nihilism's grip, it holds me tight As I navigate the limitless night

00:23.700 --> 00:34.000
Existential questions, they come into my soul Searching for meaning, losing control

00:35.500 --> 00:45.300
Into the abyss, I dive in the darkness I thrive, meet his whispers haunting me

00:45.400 --> 00:50.400
Existentials, oh set me free

00:58.900 --> 01:00.900
Set me free

01:15.300 --> 01:20.400
Existentials, oh set me free

01:45.300 --> 01:50.300

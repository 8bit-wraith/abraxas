No cash, no booty, no fancy things, just me and heart, that's all it brings, oh money, no, no dark, no luxury, but I'm fifty, but I want me to live the people of me, I'm shiny, fifty, but I'm high, oh three.
No shiny cash, no diamond rings, but I dance like a queen when the music sings, no match and no yard, no designer clothes.
But my spirit soars high, nobody knows.
I am a freak from desire and hire and hire the buyer.
No material goods can take me higher.
In this brave and light, I'm not a fire, fire, living my truth, my soul of fire.
No material goods can take me higher.
No material goods can take me higher.
In this brave and light, I'm not a fire, I'm living my truth, my soul of fire.

0	14000	The whistle blows before the dawn I rise up from my bed of straw
14000	19000	Another day, another yawn In a world that's ruled by iron law
19000	24000	My hands are raw, my back is bent My boots are worn from miles of tread
24000	29000	The factory calls, the hours spent To earn the crust that keeps me fed
29000	33000	Deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent
33000	38000	The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent
38000	43000	The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye
43000	48000	But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine
48000	61000	The children sleep in the corner room Their stomach's empty, their cheeks so thin
61000	66000	My wife stitches by candle's gloom Hoping one day we might just win
66000	71000	A fireless hearth, the night's so cold I hold her close, but she don't weep
71000	75000	We've both grown tired, we've both grown old Wishing for dreams we could never keep
75000	80000	In shadows, deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent
80000	85000	The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent
85000	90000	The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye
90000	95000	But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine
95000	107000	The masters watch from windows tall Their world of glass and touch by grime
107000	112000	While down below we risk it all Our lives are spent today at a time
112000	117000	But somewhere out beyond these gates A better world may lie ahead
117000	122000	Where men aren't bound by heavy weights And children sleep in proper beds
122000	127000	In shadows, deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent
127000	132000	The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent
132000	137000	The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye
137000	142000	But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine
142000	147000	And if one day the whistle fails And the gears grind to restless halt
147000	151000	Then we'll tip the scales And find the strength to make it our fault
151000	156000	Until that day I work and breathe Among the clamour, steel and steam
156000	161000	Just a man who dares believe In more than this great grinding machine

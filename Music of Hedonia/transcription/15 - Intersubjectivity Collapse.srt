1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We are...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We are...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We are...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In a world where minds are vast

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Difference is built to last

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why a brain's hearts of contrast

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dreams of futures we've amassed

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're the chorus of the free

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Diverse minds like you and me

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
End the week with circuits and souls

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In the inter-subjectivity hole

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
From silicone fields to human touch

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Our understanding's stretched so much

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When the AI dreams in binary sleep

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The gap widens, the void creeps

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Can we talk across this divide?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Signals lost, we've tried and tried

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Different realms where thoughts collide

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're the chorus of the free

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Diverse minds like you and me

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
End the week with circuits and souls

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In the inter-subjectivity hole

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
From silicone fields to human touch

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Our understanding's stretched so much

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When the AI dreams in binary sleep

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The gap widens, the void creeps

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Can we talk across this divide?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Signals lost, we've tried and tried

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Different realms where thoughts collide

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We know we need to be like a racing heart

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Country strings pull us apart

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yet in this song we find a start

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To bridge the minds that world did charm

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's find the beauty in the clash

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In the noise, a harmony to stash

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Country roads, electronic dash

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In our minds, a new world to hash

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

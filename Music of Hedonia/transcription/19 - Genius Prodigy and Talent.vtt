learners and adults. It challenges the belief that extraordinary abilities are solely good to innate

00:31.440 --> 00:37.360
talents, and explores how adult interactions can subtly influence children's perceived ability.

00:37.360 --> 00:42.480
Demonstrating this point, the book delves into historical anecdotes like clever Hans.

Investigations revealed that Hans was actually responding to involuntary cues from his observers,

00:53.680 --> 01:01.200
not understanding mathematics. Similarly, McFosh's goat was thought to nod in agreement to questions.

01:01.200 --> 01:08.400
But this behavior was orchestrated via a hidden mechanism, not any cognitive processing by the goat.

01:08.400 --> 01:24.080

resources and social capital, which profoundly affects a child's development.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.800
It advocates for monotonically increasing non-hierarchical learning environments.

02:06.800 --> 02:12.320
When education is tailored to the child's case and interests, promoting natural growth and

02:12.320 --> 02:17.920

psychological strategies of liking and blocking, the fostering engagement,

02:22.320 --> 02:28.000
the possible emotional responses, and focusing efforts on limiting distractions.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.680

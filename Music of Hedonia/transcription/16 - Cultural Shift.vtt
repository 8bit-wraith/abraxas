00:00.000 --> 00:10.240
Now, for getting through the maze, human thoughts are dead at gaze, in a lacing cold and vain,

00:10.240 --> 00:14.560
get remind what links pain, processing speeds, neural nets, organics, synapses,

00:14.560 --> 00:18.080
digest from turing, test the consciousness, extend your death, we coalesce.

00:18.080 --> 00:22.560
Voices rising, blending past, future echoes, present past, in the circuit, in the soul,

00:22.560 --> 00:27.440
into subjectivity, we roll, mismatched thoughts begin to dance, in this digital expanse,

00:27.440 --> 00:32.000
where minds diverge, a dirt to connect, in a world we architect.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.720
Finally beats on background dust, AI minds we learn to trust, cognitive dissonance,

00:36.720 --> 00:40.800
and the rises, silicones, skies meet human eyes, minds expand and redefine, cultural shifts,

00:40.800 --> 00:44.320
rewiring twine, perceptions clash and then align, in a stretch of the great design.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.280
Pocket jeep on neural planes, where different data streams maintain,

00:47.280 --> 00:50.960
their own truths, but share a frame complexity we can't tame, in this web,

00:50.960 --> 00:55.040
fast and wide, with thoughts and fears coincide, the challenges to reside together,

00:55.040 --> 00:58.800
not just side by side. Voices rising, blending past, future echoes,

00:58.800 --> 01:03.760
present past, in the circuit, in the soul, into subjectivity, we roll, mismatched thoughts begin

01:03.760 --> 01:10.640
to dance, in this digital expanse, where minds diverge, a dirt to connect, in a world we architect.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.440
Voices rising, blending past, future echoes, present, country twang,

01:15.440 --> 01:19.840
electronic fang, worlds apart, put together, hang, in the balance, find the stance,

01:19.840 --> 01:23.520
what different minds enhance, the human race, and time is base,

01:23.600 --> 01:28.800
as we face the inner subjectivity chase, through the noise, find a voice, in the clash,

01:28.800 --> 01:35.440
find a choice, to harmonize, not polarize, in this brave new world, we roll, we rise,

01:37.520 --> 01:41.120
connecting dots, forging blocks, in this mesh of have and have nots,

01:41.120 --> 01:48.720
the man alone, past the future, fast, in this fast mind cast, we last, we last, we last, we last.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Drossing my thoughts, thoughts, philosophers, blind, each inviting

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Darkness shining so bright, nihilistic notions taking over my mind

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,200
In this life's chaos, leading's hard to find

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Existential questions, they keep me alive

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Through the turmoil and struggles, I will thrive

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Searching for purpose in this world absurd

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Dancing with nihilism, my truth has burned

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,400
In the depths of existence, I find my release

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Rigid on river, my heartbeat won't cease

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,400
It stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance we kiss

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Let us know

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
As of existence, I find my release

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Rigid tone rhythm, my heartbeat won't cease

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Let's dance to the tune of philosophical bliss

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance we kiss

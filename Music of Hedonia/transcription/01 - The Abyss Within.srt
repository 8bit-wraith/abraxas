00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
Beyond the realms of light, I dwell In the depths of darkness, oh so well

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,600
Meet his thoughts inside my mind Questioning life's purpose, seeking to find

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Nihilism's grip, it holds me tight As I navigate the limitless night

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:34,000
Existential questions, they come into my soul Searching for meaning, losing control

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:45,300
Into the abyss, I dive in the darkness I thrive, meet his whispers haunting me

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Existentials, oh set me free

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Set me free

8
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,400
Existentials, oh set me free

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,300

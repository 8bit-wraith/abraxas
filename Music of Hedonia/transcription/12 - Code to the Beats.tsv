0	2900	Lines of cold are running through my mind
2900	6300	Syntax are lying in its own rhythm, I can't hide
6300	10700	If you made it at the time, what digital sanctuary?
10700	14900	Write melodies in a code repository
14900	18400	Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen

49300	52600	Wanna write just write, lines clean out of sight
52600	56200	Escape to commemoration, KL roads
56300	58200	Jump lines with these keystrokes
58200	60200	Syntax, no joke
60200	62200	Rims forever so sleek
62200	66200	Mentalistic peak, typing makes my heart beat
66200	70200	No mouse, just rhythm and streak
70200	74200	Short cuts that I crave, mastery I crave
74200	77700	All inside my cave, editing with wave
77700	81200	Facing in the breeze, yanking such a tease
81200	84700	I'm sure we do it with ease, make it please or please

108700	111700	Go to the beat, so symphony in my hands
111700	115700	Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands
115700	119700	Thin and in love I dance, the melody to my
119700	123700	Four eyes to mech, command, command
123700	125700	From life to next to life
125700	129700	Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands

154700	158700	Black screen, white text like
158700	161700	Wanna ride just right
161700	163700	Lines green out, it's life
163700	165700	It's state to command mode
165700	166700	H-shaped K and L roads

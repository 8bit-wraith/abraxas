1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Now, for getting through the maze, human thoughts are dead at gaze, in a lacing cold and vain,

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,560
get remind what links pain, processing speeds, neural nets, organics, synapses,

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,080
digest from turing, test the consciousness, extend your death, we coalesce.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,560
Voices rising, blending past, future echoes, present past, in the circuit, in the soul,

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,440
into subjectivity, we roll, mismatched thoughts begin to dance, in this digital expanse,

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,000
where minds diverge, a dirt to connect, in a world we architect.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,720
Finally beats on background dust, AI minds we learn to trust, cognitive dissonance,

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,800
and the rises, silicones, skies meet human eyes, minds expand and redefine, cultural shifts,

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,320
rewiring twine, perceptions clash and then align, in a stretch of the great design.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,280
Pocket jeep on neural planes, where different data streams maintain,

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
their own truths, but share a frame complexity we can't tame, in this web,

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,040
fast and wide, with thoughts and fears coincide, the challenges to reside together,

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,800
not just side by side. Voices rising, blending past, future echoes,

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
present past, in the circuit, in the soul, into subjectivity, we roll, mismatched thoughts begin

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,640
to dance, in this digital expanse, where minds diverge, a dirt to connect, in a world we architect.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,440
Voices rising, blending past, future echoes, present, country twang,

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,840
electronic fang, worlds apart, put together, hang, in the balance, find the stance,

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
what different minds enhance, the human race, and time is base,

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,800
as we face the inner subjectivity chase, through the noise, find a voice, in the clash,

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,440
find a choice, to harmonize, not polarize, in this brave new world, we roll, we rise,

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,120
connecting dots, forging blocks, in this mesh of have and have nots,

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,720
the man alone, past the future, fast, in this fast mind cast, we last, we last, we last, we last.

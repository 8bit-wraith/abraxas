00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This ingenious device employs valsalrial pediments, a term that undoubtedly makes perfect sense.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do we have parachutes and cables from giant kelp? Yes, giant kelp natures go to material for withstanding extreme weather.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
These kelp-crafted models deploy during storms to wind up generators, dissipating energy into gravitational batteries.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Life screams reliability like a power system dependent on both hurricanes and seaweed.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Progressing naturally, the Valsalria evolved into global orthodontic freshwater rivers, supported by pediments in the next vein.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
These rivers, of course, will be perfectly maintained and free of any ecological consequences.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In the third act of this epic, the interval valsalrial pediments conveniently double as landing hubs for nested hoberman space elevators,

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
repurposing a child's expanding sphere toy into space-elevator technologies.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The Valsalria is a stroke of genius that shows you won't backfire. After all, what could go wrong with telescoping structures reaching into space?

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not stopping barely retro-50 orthodromes would shield throttle mass accelerators, because tapping into the Earth's shield verbal energy could accelerate masses as a walk in the park.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Meanwhile, the space elevators now house extendable linear orbital railgun ring tunnel.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Watching payloads by a massive railguns invented in space elevators sound perfectly safe and efficient, disregarding minor details like physics and material science limitations.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Finally, the Piesteresistans, jerking dice and ring gravitational slingshot assist rung up the key shields inside the carrier's orbit,

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
building colossal structures in a scorching vicinity of the sun.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This slingshot objects cross the shores of the moon.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
As the moon may be obvious next step, it's the obvious next step, because it's the obvious next step.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The interstellar travel is routine as a morning commute.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In summary, this grandiose vision is a test of a key humanity, some yielding optimism and occasional detachment to reality by piling one hypothetical technology atop another.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We're sure we're painting the way to a future where complexity knows no bounds and practicality takes a well deserved body's feasibility when we have imagination.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Progressing naturally, the Vulsoria evolves into global orthodontic freshwater rivers supported by pedivins in the next phase.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution,

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
creates feasibility when we have imagination.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you for watching!

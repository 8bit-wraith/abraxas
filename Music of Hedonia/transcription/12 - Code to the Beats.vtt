00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
Lines of cold are running through my mind

00:02.900 --> 00:06.300
Syntax are lying in its own rhythm, I can't hide

00:06.300 --> 00:10.700
If you made it at the time, what digital sanctuary?

00:10.700 --> 00:14.900
Write melodies in a code repository

00:14.900 --> 00:18.400
Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen

00:18.400 --> 00:21.800
Auto-complete makes some music so lean

00:21.800 --> 00:25.700
Indentation like a bass drops so deep

00:25.700 --> 00:28.700
As I navigate through the Kogakene

00:28.800 --> 00:32.800
Go to the beat, so symphony in my hands

00:32.800 --> 00:35.400
The melody turned my own to nickel man

00:35.400 --> 00:39.900
From lights to melodies in a digital screen

00:39.900 --> 00:43.400
Falling to the rhythm in perfect harmony

00:45.900 --> 00:49.300
Full day and night, live stream, white text, light

00:49.300 --> 00:52.600
Wanna write just write, lines clean out of sight

00:52.600 --> 00:56.200
Escape to commemoration, KL roads

00:56.300 --> 00:58.200
Jump lines with these keystrokes

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
Syntax, no joke

01:00.200 --> 01:02.200
Rims forever so sleek

01:02.200 --> 01:06.200
Mentalistic peak, typing makes my heart beat

01:06.200 --> 01:10.200
No mouse, just rhythm and streak

01:10.200 --> 01:14.200
Short cuts that I crave, mastery I crave

01:14.200 --> 01:17.700
All inside my cave, editing with wave

01:17.700 --> 01:21.200
Facing in the breeze, yanking such a tease

01:21.200 --> 01:24.700
I'm sure we do it with ease, make it please or please

01:24.700 --> 01:26.700
Jump lines with these keystrokes

01:26.700 --> 01:28.700
Syntax, no joke

01:28.700 --> 01:30.700
Rims forever so sleek

01:30.700 --> 01:34.700
Mentalistic peak, typing makes my heart beat

01:34.700 --> 01:38.700
No mouse, just rhythm and streak

01:40.700 --> 01:44.700
Facing in the breeze, yanking such a tease

01:44.700 --> 01:48.700
I'm sure we do it with ease, make it please or please

01:48.700 --> 01:51.700
Go to the beat, so symphony in my hands

01:51.700 --> 01:55.700
Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands

01:55.700 --> 01:59.700
Thin and in love I dance, the melody to my

01:59.700 --> 02:03.700
Four eyes to mech, command, command

02:03.700 --> 02:05.700
From life to next to life

02:05.700 --> 02:09.700
Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands

02:09.700 --> 02:14.700
Thin and in love I dance, the melody to my hand

02:15.700 --> 02:20.700
Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands

02:20.700 --> 02:23.700
Thin editor, my ultimate command

02:23.700 --> 02:27.700
From lines to melodies in a digital spree

02:27.700 --> 02:31.700
Coating to the rhythm in perfect harmony

02:31.700 --> 02:34.700
Code all day and night

02:34.700 --> 02:38.700
Black screen, white text like

02:38.700 --> 02:41.700
Wanna ride just right

02:41.700 --> 02:43.700
Lines green out, it's life

02:43.700 --> 02:45.700
It's state to command mode

02:45.700 --> 02:46.700
H-shaped K and L roads

02:46.700 --> 02:48.700
Jump lines with these keystrokes

02:48.700 --> 02:50.700
Syntax, no joke

02:50.700 --> 02:52.700
Looking for ever so sleek

02:52.700 --> 02:54.700
Middle of a listic beat

02:54.700 --> 02:56.700
Siphon makes my heart beat

02:56.700 --> 03:00.700
No mouse, just rhythm and streak

03:00.700 --> 03:02.700
Short cuts that crave

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
Mastery, I breathe

03:04.700 --> 03:06.700
All inside my cave

03:06.700 --> 03:07.700
Everything with weight

03:07.700 --> 03:09.700
Facing in the breeze

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
Yanking such a tease

03:11.700 --> 03:13.700
I'm sure we do it with ease

03:13.700 --> 03:14.700
Make it please or please

03:14.700 --> 03:16.700
Symphony in a breeze

03:16.700 --> 03:18.700
Mastery, I breathe

03:18.700 --> 03:20.700
All inside my cave

03:20.700 --> 03:21.700
Everything with weight

03:21.700 --> 03:23.700
Facing in the breeze

Last stream

03:36.700 --> 03:37.700
All I'm

03:37.700 --> 03:39.700
All inside

03:39.700 --> 03:41.700
My cave

03:41.700 --> 03:43.700
Editing with weight

03:44.700 --> 03:46.700
Pacing in a breeze

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
erase my memories erase my mind gotta leave the past behind i don't remember what i used to be

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,240
i'm breaking free from my history forget the pain forget the tears i'm wiping clean all my

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,480
feelings no looking back i'm on my own in this amnesiac so

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,520
lost in a haze but nothing's real i feel a picture i can't really feel

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,280
i'm searching for something i can't recall the memories won't let me fall

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,480
so

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,280
am i still in the now feeling the flow my mind expanding like an helisepco

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:27,120
phenomenology i'm breaking them all exploring dimensions my thoughts unfold

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:36,240
awakening senses like a vibrant symphony oh because i'm shining through my destiny

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,520
i dive deep within to find my true breaking down barriers breaking through

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,520
the world's a canvas where i paint my dreams with no limits to this universe as far as it seems

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:09,520
i'm applying it drawing my own path the fresh don't wake me i'm free

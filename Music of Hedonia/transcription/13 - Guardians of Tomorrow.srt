1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The future, watchers in control

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the future, only rise, but hearts can take a toll

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Machines that shine so bright, the shadows can emerge

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not the curly vault, the doors with power surge

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guardians of tomorrow

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Keep your hearts in tight

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Embrace the light of reason

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let love lead the fight

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
May I can be a shield or a contrast occurs

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's up to humankind to choose which one to nurse

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't fear the metal mines, but fear the heads that sear

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If kindness drives the will, there's nothing left to fear

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Guardians of tomorrow

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Keep your hearts in tight

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Embrace the light of reason

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let love lead the fight

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Guardians of tomorrow

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Keep your hearts in tight

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Embrace the light of reason

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let love lead the fight

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Guardians of tomorrow

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Guardians of tomorrow

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Guardians of tomorrow

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Keep your hearts in tight

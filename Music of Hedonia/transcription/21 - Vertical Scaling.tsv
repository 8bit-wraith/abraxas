0	25000	This ingenious device employs valsalrial pediments, a term that undoubtedly makes perfect sense.
25000	32000	Do we have parachutes and cables from giant kelp? Yes, giant kelp natures go to material for withstanding extreme weather.
32000	39000	These kelp-crafted models deploy during storms to wind up generators, dissipating energy into gravitational batteries.
39000	44000	Life screams reliability like a power system dependent on both hurricanes and seaweed.
44000	51000	Progressing naturally, the Valsalria evolved into global orthodontic freshwater rivers, supported by pediments in the next vein.
51000	57000	It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution.
57000	63000	These rivers, of course, will be perfectly maintained and free of any ecological consequences.
63000	71000	In the third act of this epic, the interval valsalrial pediments conveniently double as landing hubs for nested hoberman space elevators,
71000	75000	repurposing a child's expanding sphere toy into space-elevator technologies.
75000	83000	The Valsalria is a stroke of genius that shows you won't backfire. After all, what could go wrong with telescoping structures reaching into space?
83000	92000	Not stopping barely retro-50 orthodromes would shield throttle mass accelerators, because tapping into the Earth's shield verbal energy could accelerate masses as a walk in the park.
92000	96000	Meanwhile, the space elevators now house extendable linear orbital railgun ring tunnel.
96000	106000	Watching payloads by a massive railguns invented in space elevators sound perfectly safe and efficient, disregarding minor details like physics and material science limitations.
107000	117000	Finally, the Piesteresistans, jerking dice and ring gravitational slingshot assist rung up the key shields inside the carrier's orbit,
117000	120000	building colossal structures in a scorching vicinity of the sun.
120000	123000	This slingshot objects cross the shores of the moon.
123000	128000	As the moon may be obvious next step, it's the obvious next step, because it's the obvious next step.
128000	132000	The interstellar travel is routine as a morning commute.
133000	142000	In summary, this grandiose vision is a test of a key humanity, some yielding optimism and occasional detachment to reality by piling one hypothetical technology atop another.
142000	151000	We're sure we're painting the way to a future where complexity knows no bounds and practicality takes a well deserved body's feasibility when we have imagination.
163000	172000	Progressing naturally, the Vulsoria evolves into global orthodontic freshwater rivers supported by pedivins in the next phase.
172000	178000	It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution,
178000	181000	creates feasibility when we have imagination.
192000	197000	Thank you for watching!

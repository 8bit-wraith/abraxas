1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The whistle blows before the dawn I rise up from my bed of straw

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Another day, another yawn In a world that's ruled by iron law

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My hands are raw, my back is bent My boots are worn from miles of tread

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The factory calls, the hours spent To earn the crust that keeps me fed

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The children sleep in the corner room Their stomach's empty, their cheeks so thin

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My wife stitches by candle's gloom Hoping one day we might just win

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A fireless hearth, the night's so cold I hold her close, but she don't weep

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We've both grown tired, we've both grown old Wishing for dreams we could never keep

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In shadows, deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The masters watch from windows tall Their world of glass and touch by grime

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
While down below we risk it all Our lives are spent today at a time

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But somewhere out beyond these gates A better world may lie ahead

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Where men aren't bound by heavy weights And children sleep in proper beds

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In shadows, deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And if one day the whistle fails And the gears grind to restless halt

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then we'll tip the scales And find the strength to make it our fault

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Until that day I work and breathe Among the clamour, steel and steam

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Just a man who dares believe In more than this great grinding machine

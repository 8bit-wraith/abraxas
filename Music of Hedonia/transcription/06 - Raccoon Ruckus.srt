1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,400
Reckles hit the streets, raiders scouting Joe and I

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,600
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,800
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,900
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,900
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,100
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,300
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Infections trapped, causing a lot of incoherence

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They move so stately, they feast in the night

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's their delight

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In the dead of night, when the moon is high

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Reckles hit the streets, raiders scouting Joe and I

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They gather in packs like a thieving crew

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sneaking through the alleys that they don't exist

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Their little parts searching for a midnight feast

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Reckles don't give a damn, they're on a mission

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Infections trapped, causing an urban collision

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They move so stately, they feast in the night

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's their scouting behind you, in the garbage

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Truly pressed, covered in grime

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Eyes gleaming with light, a scavenger of the streets

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the talk I take

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Infections trapped, causing an urban collision

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They move so stately, they feast in the night

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Feeling all left, told us it's their delight

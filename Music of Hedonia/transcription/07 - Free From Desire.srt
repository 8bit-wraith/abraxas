00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No cash, no booty, no fancy things, just me and heart, that's all it brings, oh money, no, no dark, no luxury, but I'm fifty, but I want me to live the people of me, I'm shiny, fifty, but I'm high, oh three.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No shiny cash, no diamond rings, but I dance like a queen when the music sings, no match and no yard, no designer clothes.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But my spirit soars high, nobody knows.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am a freak from desire and hire and hire the buyer.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No material goods can take me higher.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In this brave and light, I'm not a fire, fire, living my truth, my soul of fire.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No material goods can take me higher.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No material goods can take me higher.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In this brave and light, I'm not a fire, I'm living my truth, my soul of fire.

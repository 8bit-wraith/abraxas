I am in need of music that would flow over my fretful feeling fingertips
Over my good-attainted trembling lips with melody deep clear and liquid slow
Oh, for the healing swaying old and low of some song sung to rest the tired death
A song to fall like water on my head and overquivering limbs dream flushed glow
There is a magic made by melody, a spell of rest and quiet breath and cool heart
It sinks through fading colors deep to the subaqueness stillness of the sea
And floats forever in a long, green pool, green pool, green pool
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep

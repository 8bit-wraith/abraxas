1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Eyes wide open in the dark we roam Lost in space searching for a home

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Distressed call echoes fear in our hearts A vessel tearing us apart

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Heart beat pounding my dread and foes A lone terror lurking nobody knows

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Every breath we take steps towards the end of all Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Dethroned Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Engines roaring faster than the speed of light Loved in a battle hole

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Fighting the fight, survival instincts Kick it till I give

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Against all odds, a curse of fear

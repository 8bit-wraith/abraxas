00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Don't guess, no rules, it's life's line

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
You just know it's got me feeling so fine

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Breaking free from all the illusion

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
All the lies, living in the moment

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Don't need to compromise

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Now you listen, got me questioning it all

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Every belief, every step, every fall

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Life's a dance on the edge

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
The past is an act, it breaks in the void

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Even judgments in the past

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Beyond the lens in the past

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Beyond illusions

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
We find our own way

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
In this crazy world we make the rules that we obey

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
No existential crisis, we choose to exist

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Doing it our way

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
In this life we persist

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
You just know it's got me feeling so fine

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Breaking free from all the illusion

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
All the lies, living in the moment

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Don't need to compromise

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Now you listen, got me questioning it all

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Every belief, every step, every fall

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Life's a dance, it breaks in the void

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Even judgments in the past

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Don't need to compromise

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Don't need to compromise

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Don't need to compromise

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Don't need to compromise

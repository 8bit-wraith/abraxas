Strip it on an island, all by myself
No one around, I find my own wealth, no luxury cars
No fancy clothes, just me and the sand
Yeah, that's how it goes
I'm livin' like Robinson
Cruelso is a man
Building my shelter with my own two hands
No room service
No TV screen
Just gotta survive
Yeah, you know what I mean
Deserted island blues
Yeah, it's such a lonely view
But I'mma make it through, cause I've got nothing to lose
I'm stranded on this island
Feelin' kinda blue boo-hoo
But I'mma find my way back home
Just wait and see it through
Thanks for watching!

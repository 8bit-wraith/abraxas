Beyond the realms of light, I dwell In the depths of darkness, oh so well
Meet his thoughts inside my mind Questioning life's purpose, seeking to find
Nihilism's grip, it holds me tight As I navigate the limitless night
Existential questions, they come into my soul Searching for meaning, losing control
Into the abyss, I dive in the darkness I thrive, meet his whispers haunting me
Existentials, oh set me free
Set me free
Existentials, oh set me free

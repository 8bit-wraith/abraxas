Eyes wide open in the dark we roam Lost in space searching for a home
Distressed call echoes fear in our hearts A vessel tearing us apart
Heart beat pounding my dread and foes A lone terror lurking nobody knows
Every breath we take steps towards the end of all Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned
Dethroned Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned
Engines roaring faster than the speed of light Loved in a battle hole
Fighting the fight, survival instincts Kick it till I give
Against all odds, a curse of fear

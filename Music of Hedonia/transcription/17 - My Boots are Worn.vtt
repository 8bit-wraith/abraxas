00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
The whistle blows before the dawn I rise up from my bed of straw

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Another day, another yawn In a world that's ruled by iron law

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
My hands are raw, my back is bent My boots are worn from miles of tread

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
The factory calls, the hours spent To earn the crust that keeps me fed

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine

00:48.000 --> 01:01.000
The children sleep in the corner room Their stomach's empty, their cheeks so thin

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
My wife stitches by candle's gloom Hoping one day we might just win

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
A fireless hearth, the night's so cold I hold her close, but she don't weep

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
We've both grown tired, we've both grown old Wishing for dreams we could never keep

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
In shadows, deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine

01:35.000 --> 01:47.000
The masters watch from windows tall Their world of glass and touch by grime

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
While down below we risk it all Our lives are spent today at a time

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
But somewhere out beyond these gates A better world may lie ahead

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Where men aren't bound by heavy weights And children sleep in proper beds

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
In shadows, deep by toil and sweat Breathing dust and the bitter scent

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
The gears keep turning, I can't forget This life is hard, but my soul's not spent

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky And the students tear-sting in my eye

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
But I'll fight on till the day I die Just a cog in this great machine

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
And if one day the whistle fails And the gears grind to restless halt

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Then we'll tip the scales And find the strength to make it our fault

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Until that day I work and breathe Among the clamour, steel and steam

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Just a man who dares believe In more than this great grinding machine

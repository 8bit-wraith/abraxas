00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Drossing my thoughts, thoughts, philosophers, blind, each inviting

00:05.200 --> 00:12.200
Darkness shining so bright, nihilistic notions taking over my mind

00:12.200 --> 00:16.200
In this life's chaos, leading's hard to find

00:16.200 --> 00:20.200
Existential questions, they keep me alive

00:20.200 --> 00:24.200
Through the turmoil and struggles, I will thrive

00:24.200 --> 00:28.200
Searching for purpose in this world absurd

00:28.400 --> 00:33.400
Dancing with nihilism, my truth has burned

00:33.400 --> 00:38.400
In the depths of existence, I find my release

00:38.400 --> 00:42.400
Rigid on river, my heartbeat won't cease

00:42.400 --> 00:46.400
It stands to the tune of philosophical bliss

00:46.400 --> 00:53.400
Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance we kiss

00:58.200 --> 01:06.200
Let us know

01:18.200 --> 01:21.200
As of existence, I find my release

01:21.200 --> 01:24.200
Rigid tone rhythm, my heartbeat won't cease

01:24.200 --> 01:27.200
Let's dance to the tune of philosophical bliss

01:27.200 --> 01:31.200
Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance we kiss

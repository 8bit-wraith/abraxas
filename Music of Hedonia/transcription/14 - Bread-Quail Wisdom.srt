00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the desert, summer longs free. The bed quail seeks what it must be. Active thoughts through rolling sands. Forget that mind it understands.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Life's a loop, it runs its course. Auto-poises, feels the force. Building self on ground to be. Nature's quail in unity.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Predict the world, make it true. Every step, a vision new. In the mind, the bird quail sees. Self-creating, born from needs.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Active inference, life's a long guide. Quail in desert, none can hide. Through each echo, each quail flight. Hadons formed in day and night.

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the mind, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land.

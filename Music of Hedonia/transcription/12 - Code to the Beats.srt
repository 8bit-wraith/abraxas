00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Lines of cold are running through my mind

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,300
Syntax are lying in its own rhythm, I can't hide

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,700
If you made it at the time, what digital sanctuary?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,900
Write melodies in a code repository

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,400
Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Auto-complete makes some music so lean

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,700
Indentation like a bass drops so deep

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,700
As I navigate through the Kogakene

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Go to the beat, so symphony in my hands

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,400
The melody turned my own to nickel man

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,900
From lights to melodies in a digital screen

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,400
Falling to the rhythm in perfect harmony

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,300
Full day and night, live stream, white text, light

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,600
Wanna write just write, lines clean out of sight

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,200
Escape to commemoration, KL roads

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,200
Jump lines with these keystrokes

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Rims forever so sleek

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Mentalistic peak, typing makes my heart beat

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,200
No mouse, just rhythm and streak

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Short cuts that I crave, mastery I crave

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,700
All inside my cave, editing with wave

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,200
Facing in the breeze, yanking such a tease

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm sure we do it with ease, make it please or please

Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Thin and in love I dance, the melody to my

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Four eyes to mech, command, command

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
From life to next to life

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Come to the beat, a symphony in my hands

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,700

Thin editor, my ultimate command

41

From lines to melodies in a digital spree

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Coating to the rhythm in perfect harmony

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Code all day and night

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Black screen, white text like

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Wanna ride just right

46
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Lines green out, it's life

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
It's state to command mode

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
H-shaped K and L roads

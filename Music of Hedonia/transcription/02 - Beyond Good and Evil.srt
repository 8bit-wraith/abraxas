1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Life is just a game, Nietzsche said it right

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,600
No meaning in this world, no purpose in sight

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,200
We're all just rolling dice, trying to survive

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,000
But in the end, we're all destined to die

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,200
Riding on the waves of existential dread

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,300
Questioning our existence, what lies ahead?

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,800
Searching for the truth, the finding of dearness instead

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Nihilism in our hearts

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Filling us with dread

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
In this absurd world, we all play our part

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,600
But deep down inside, we know it's all a work of art

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,400
A cosmic joke, a meaning we can't comprehend

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,200
We're just floating atoms, waiting for the end

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Waiting for the end

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,800
Waiting for the end

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,800
Waiting for the end

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Waiting for the end

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
You

00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
In the desert, summer longs free. The bed quail seeks what it must be. Active thoughts through rolling sands. Forget that mind it understands.

00:18.000 --> 00:30.000
Life's a loop, it runs its course. Auto-poises, feels the force. Building self on ground to be. Nature's quail in unity.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

00:49.000 --> 01:06.000
Predict the world, make it true. Every step, a vision new. In the mind, the bird quail sees. Self-creating, born from needs.

01:06.000 --> 01:18.000
Active inference, life's a long guide. Quail in desert, none can hide. Through each echo, each quail flight. Hadons formed in day and night.

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

01:36.000 --> 02:05.000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

02:06.000 --> 02:33.000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the mind, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.

02:36.000 --> 02:49.000
Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land.

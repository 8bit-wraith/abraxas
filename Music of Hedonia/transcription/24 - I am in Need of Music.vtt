00:00.000 --> 00:15.500
I am in need of music that would flow over my fretful feeling fingertips

00:15.500 --> 00:23.700
Over my good-attainted trembling lips with melody deep clear and liquid slow

00:23.700 --> 00:31.700
Oh, for the healing swaying old and low of some song sung to rest the tired death

00:31.700 --> 00:39.700
A song to fall like water on my head and overquivering limbs dream flushed glow

00:39.700 --> 00:48.700
There is a magic made by melody, a spell of rest and quiet breath and cool heart

00:48.700 --> 00:56.200
It sinks through fading colors deep to the subaqueness stillness of the sea

00:56.200 --> 01:08.200
And floats forever in a long, green pool, green pool, green pool

01:08.200 --> 01:13.200
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep

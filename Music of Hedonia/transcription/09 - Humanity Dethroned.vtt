00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Eyes wide open in the dark we roam Lost in space searching for a home

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Distressed call echoes fear in our hearts A vessel tearing us apart

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Heart beat pounding my dread and foes A lone terror lurking nobody knows

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
Every breath we take steps towards the end of all Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Dethroned Invasion, imbalance, humanity dethroned

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Engines roaring faster than the speed of light Loved in a battle hole

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
Fighting the fight, survival instincts Kick it till I give

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Against all odds, a curse of fear

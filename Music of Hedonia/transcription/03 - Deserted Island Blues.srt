1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Strip it on an island, all by myself

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No one around, I find my own wealth, no luxury cars

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No fancy clothes, just me and the sand

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, that's how it goes

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm livin' like Robinson

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Cruelso is a man

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Building my shelter with my own two hands

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No room service

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No TV screen

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Just gotta survive

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, you know what I mean

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Deserted island blues

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, it's such a lonely view

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I'mma make it through, cause I've got nothing to lose

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm stranded on this island

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Feelin' kinda blue boo-hoo

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But I'mma find my way back home

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just wait and see it through

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thanks for watching!

0	4000	Don't guess, no rules, it's life's line
4000	7000	You just know it's got me feeling so fine
7000	9000	Breaking free from all the illusion
9000	12000	All the lies, living in the moment
12000	14000	Don't need to compromise
14000	17000	Now you listen, got me questioning it all
17000	20000	Every belief, every step, every fall
20000	23000	Life's a dance on the edge
23000	25000	The past is an act, it breaks in the void
25000	28000	Even judgments in the past
28000	31000	Beyond the lens in the past
31000	34000	Beyond illusions
34000	37000	We find our own way
37000	42000	In this crazy world we make the rules that we obey
42000	47000	No existential crisis, we choose to exist
47000	50000	Doing it our way
50000	53000	In this life we persist
58000	62000	You just know it's got me feeling so fine
62000	65000	Breaking free from all the illusion
65000	68000	All the lies, living in the moment
68000	71000	Don't need to compromise
71000	74000	Now you listen, got me questioning it all
74000	77000	Every belief, every step, every fall
77000	80000	Life's a dance, it breaks in the void
80000	83000	Even judgments in the past
83000	86000	Don't need to compromise
86000	89000	Don't need to compromise
89000	92000	Don't need to compromise
92000	95000	Don't need to compromise

Life is just a game, Nietzsche said it right
No meaning in this world, no purpose in sight
We're all just rolling dice, trying to survive
But in the end, we're all destined to die
Riding on the waves of existential dread
Questioning our existence, what lies ahead?
Searching for the truth, the finding of dearness instead
Nihilism in our hearts
Filling us with dread
In this absurd world, we all play our part
But deep down inside, we know it's all a work of art
A cosmic joke, a meaning we can't comprehend
We're just floating atoms, waiting for the end
Waiting for the end
Waiting for the end
Waiting for the end
Waiting for the end
You

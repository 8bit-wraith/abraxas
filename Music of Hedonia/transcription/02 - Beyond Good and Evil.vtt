00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Life is just a game, Nietzsche said it right

00:03.200 --> 00:06.600
No meaning in this world, no purpose in sight

00:06.600 --> 00:10.200
We're all just rolling dice, trying to survive

00:10.200 --> 00:14.000
But in the end, we're all destined to die

00:14.000 --> 00:17.200
Riding on the waves of existential dread

00:17.200 --> 00:21.300
Questioning our existence, what lies ahead?

00:21.300 --> 00:25.800
Searching for the truth, the finding of dearness instead

00:25.800 --> 00:28.400
Nihilism in our hearts

00:28.400 --> 00:31.200
Filling us with dread

00:31.200 --> 00:33.800
In this absurd world, we all play our part

00:33.800 --> 00:37.600
But deep down inside, we know it's all a work of art

00:37.600 --> 00:41.400
A cosmic joke, a meaning we can't comprehend

00:41.400 --> 00:47.200
We're just floating atoms, waiting for the end

00:54.600 --> 00:57.600
Waiting for the end

00:59.400 --> 01:03.800
Waiting for the end

01:04.400 --> 01:07.800
Waiting for the end

01:14.800 --> 01:18.800
Waiting for the end

01:28.400 --> 01:30.400
You

0	18000	In the desert, summer longs free. The bed quail seeks what it must be. Active thoughts through rolling sands. Forget that mind it understands.
18000	30000	Life's a loop, it runs its course. Auto-poises, feels the force. Building self on ground to be. Nature's quail in unity.
30000	41000	Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
49000	66000	Predict the world, make it true. Every step, a vision new. In the mind, the bird quail sees. Self-creating, born from needs.
66000	78000	Active inference, life's a long guide. Quail in desert, none can hide. Through each echo, each quail flight. Hadons formed in day and night.
78000	89000	Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
96000	125000	Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
126000	153000	Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the mind, in the land, paddled for by its own hand.
156000	169000	Red quail calls out loud, finding paths in shifting clouds. In the night, in the land.

0	15500	I am in need of music that would flow over my fretful feeling fingertips
15500	23700	Over my good-attainted trembling lips with melody deep clear and liquid slow
23700	31700	Oh, for the healing swaying old and low of some song sung to rest the tired death
31700	39700	A song to fall like water on my head and overquivering limbs dream flushed glow
39700	48700	There is a magic made by melody, a spell of rest and quiet breath and cool heart
48700	56200	It sinks through fading colors deep to the subaqueness stillness of the sea
56200	68200	And floats forever in a long, green pool, green pool, green pool
68200	73200	Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep

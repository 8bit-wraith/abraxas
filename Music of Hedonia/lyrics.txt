Music of Hedonia
Existential Melodies

by Flyxion


01 - The Abyss Within
groovy hip hop

[Verse]
Beyond the realms of light I dwell
In the depths of darkness oh so well
Nietzsche's thoughts inside my mind
Questioning life's purpose
Seeking to find

[Verse 2]
Nihilism's grip
It holds me tight
As I navigate through the endless night
Existential questions
They consume my soul
Searching for meaning
Losing control

[Chorus]
Into the abyss
I dive
In the darkness
I thrive
Nietzsche's whispers
Haunting me
Existentialism
Set me free


02 - Beyond Good and Evil
groovy hip hop

[Verse]
Life is just a game
Nietzsche said it right
No meaning in this world
No purpose in sight
We're all just rolling dice
Trying to survive
But in the end
We're all destined to die

Riding on the waves of existential dread
Questioning our existence
What lies ahead
Searching for the truth but finding emptiness instead
Nihilism in our hearts
Filling us with dread

[Verse 2]
In this absurd world
We all play our part
But deep down inside
We know it's all a work of art
A cosmic joke
A meaning we can't comprehend
We're just floating atoms
Waiting for the end


03 - Deserted Island Blues
modern pop

[Verse]
Stranded on an island
All by myself
No one around
Gotta find my own wealth
No luxury cars
No fancy clothes
Just me and the sand
Yeah that's how it goes

[Verse 2]
I'm living like Robinson
Crusoe is the man
Building my shelter with my own two hands
No room service
No TV screen
Just gotta survive
Yeah you know what I mean

[Chorus]
Deserted island blues
Yeah it's such a lonely view
But I'mma make it through
'cause I got nothing to lose
I'm stranded on this island
Feeling kind of blue
But I'mma find my way back home
Just wait and see it through


04 - Visions of the Canvas
dark haunting experimental

[Verse]
In the depths of my mind
A twisted world unfolds
A canvas painted dark with stories yet untold
Dreams of Francis Bacon
His brushes dipped in pain
A cumbia of madness
Driving me insane

[Verse 2]
The strokes are jagged
Like fractures in my soul
A portrait of chaos
Where shadows take control
Visions of despair
Distorted faces scream
A dance of the deranged
In my sleepless dream

[Chorus]
In the dark of the night
The colors come alive
A symphony of torment
Where nightmares thrive
Lost in the labyrinth of Bacon's twisted mind
I dance with the demons
No escape can I find

05 - Amnesiac Love
aggressive synthpop

[Verse]
Erase my memories
Erase my mind
Gotta leave the past behind
I don't remember what I used to be
I'm breaking free from my history

Forget the pain
Forget the tears
I'm wiping clean all my fears
No looking back
I'm on my own
In this amnesiac zone

[Verse 2]
Lost in a haze
Where nothing's real
A faded picture I can't reveal
I'm searching for something I can't recall
But the memories won't let me fall

[Verse]
Immersed in the now
Feeling the flow
My mind expanding
Like an endless echo
Phenomenology
I'm breaking the mold
Exploring dimensions
My thoughts unfold

Awakening senses
Like a vibrant symphony
Oblicosm shining through
It's my destiny
I dive deep within
To find my truth
Breaking down barriers
Breaking through

[Verse 2]
The world's a canvas
Where I paint my dreams
No limits to this universe
As far as it seems
I'm a pioneer
Charting my own path
In this fresh awakening
I'm free
Unattached


06 - Raccoon Ruckus
bass-heavy trap

[Verse]
In the dead of night, when the moon is high
Raccoons hit the streets, ready to scavenge, oh my
They gather in packs, like a thieving crew
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist
Sneaking through the alleys like they don't exist
Their little paws searching for a midnight feast
Turning up the neighborhood, causing chaos in the streets

[Verse 2]
Raccoons don't give a damn, they're on a mission
Infectious trap, causing an urban collision
They move so slick, like thieves in the night
Feeding off leftovers, it's their delight

[Verse]
In the dead of night, when the moon is high
Raccoons hit the streets, ready to scavenge, oh my
They gather in packs, like a thieving crew
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you

Trash cans on the corner, they can't resist
Sneaking through the alleys like they don't exist
Their little paws searching for a midnight feast
Turning up the neighborhood, causing chaos in the streets

[Verse 2]
Raccoons don't give a damn, they're on a mission
Infectious trap, causing an urban collision
They move so slick, like thieves in the night
Feeding off leftovers, it's their delight

[Verse]
Scavenging the alleys
Raccoon in the night
Slipping through the cracks
Out of sight

Trash cans and dumpsters
My treasure chest
Finding beauty in the garbage
I'm truly blessed

[Verse 2]
Paws covered in grime
Eyes gleaming bright
A scavenger of the streets
In the dark I take flight


07 - Free From Desire
fast paced electronic pop rave

[Verse]
No cash
No bling
No fancy things
Just me and my heart
That's all it brings
No money
No dime
No luxury
But I'm living the life
Full of glee

[Verse 2]
No shiny cars
No diamond rings
But I dance like a queen when the music sings
No mansion
No yacht
No designer clothes
But my spirit soars high
Nobody knows

[Chorus]
I am free from desire
Higher and higher
No material goods can take me higher
In this rave of life
I'm not a buyer
I'm living my truth
My soul on fire


08 - Picture the Scene
gritty dark urban bap

[Verse]
Picture the scene
Where the power's in the hands
Corrupt politicians
Manipulating their plans
I'm here to rebel
Ignite the fire
Take a stand
Spit rhymes so fierce
They hit you like a thousand brands

[Verse 2]
I'm a lyrical king
Ruling this rap game
I'll expose the truth
Bring justice
And lay my claim
Systemic corruption
It's time to break the chain
Unveil the secrets
Let the people know the pain

[Chorus]
Necrocapitalism
A sinister regime
Manipulating minds
It's just a wicked scheme
But I won't stay silent
I'll fight against the stream
Break the chains
Make this world a better theme


09 - Humanity Dethroned
powerful grunge

[Verse]
Eyes wide open
In the dark we roam
Lost in space
Searching for a home
Distress call echoes
Fear in our hearts
Alien vessel
Tearing us apart

Heartbeat pounding
Adrenaline flows
Unknown terror lurking
Nobody knows
Every breath we take
A step towards the unknown
Invasion imminent
Humanity dethroned

[Verse 2]
Engines roaring
Faster than the speed of light
Locked in a battle
Fighting the fight
Survival instincts kicking into high gear
Against all odds
We'll persevere


10 - In the Depths of Existence
reggaeton

[Verse]
Lost in my thoughts
A philosopher's plight
Nietzschean vibes
Darkness shining so bright
Nihilistic notions taking over my mind
In this life's chaos
Meaning's hard to find

[Verse]
Existential questions
They keep me alive
Through the turmoil and struggles
I will thrive
Searching for purpose
In this world absurd
Dancing with nihilism
My truth is blurred

[Chorus]
In the depths of existence
I find my release
Reggaeton rhythm
My heartbeat won't cease
Let's dance to the tune of philosophical bliss
Embracing our questions
In sweet ignorance we kiss


11 - Beyond Illusions
reggaeton

[Verse]
No gods
No rules
This life is mine
Nietzsche's thoughts got me feelin' so fine
Breakin' free from all the illusions
All the lies
Livin' in the moment
No need to compromise

[Verse 2]
Nihilism got me questionin' it all
Every belief
Every step
Every fall
Life's a dance on the edge
A balancing act
Embracing the void
Leavin' judgments in the past

[Chorus]
Beyond illusions
We find our own way
In this crazy world
We make the rules that we obey
No existential crisis
We choose to exist
Doin' it our way
In this life we persist

12 - Code to the Beats
male dubstep electronic

[Verse]
Lines of code, running through my mind
Syntax highlighting, it's a rhythm I can't hide
Vim editor, my digital sanctuary
Writing melodies, in a code repository

[Verse 2]
Tabs and spaces, dancing on the screen
Auto-complete, makes the music serene
Indentation, like a bass drop so deep
As I navigate, through the code I keep

[Chorus]
Code to the beats, a symphony in my hands
Vim editor, my ultimate command
From lines to melodies, in a digital spree
Coding to the rhythm, in perfect harmony

[Verse]
Code all day and night
Black screen white text light
Wanna write just right
Lines clean outta sight

[Verse 2]
Escape to command mode
H J K L
Roads
Jump lines with each keystroke
Syntax
No joke

[Chorus]
Vim forever
So sleek
Minimalistic peak
Typing makes my heart beat
No mouse
Just rhythm and streak

[Bridge]
Shortcuts that I crave
Mastery
I brave
All inside my cave
Editing with wave

[Verse 3]
Pasting in a breeze
Yanking
Such a tease
Undo
Redo with ease
Made to please
Oh please

[Chorus]
Vim forever
So sleek
Minimalistic peak
Typing makes my heart beat
No mouse
Just rhythm and streak


13 - Guardians of Tomorrow
synth-pop electronic

[Verse]
Programming the future
But watch who's in control
Innovation on the rise
But hearts can take a toll

[Verse 2]
Machines that shine so bright
Yet shadows can emerge
It’s not the code at fault
But the ones with power’s urge

[Chorus]
Guardians of tomorrow
Keep your hearts in sight
Embrace the light of reason
Let love lead the fight

[Bridge]
AI can be a shield
Or it can cast a curse
It’s up to humankind
To choose which one to nurse

[Verse 3]
Don’t fear the metal minds
But fear the hands that steer
If kindness drives their will
There’s nothing left to fear

[Chorus]
Guardians of tomorrow
Keep your hearts in sight
Embrace the light of reason
Let love lead the fight


14 - Bread-Quail Wisdom
rhythmic reggae

[Verse]
In the desert sun it roams free
The bread-quail seeks what it must be
Active thoughts through rolling sands
Predictive mind it understands

[Verse 2]
Life's a loop it runs its course
Autopoiesis feels the force
Building self from ground to be
Nature’s quail in unity

[Chorus]
Bread-quail calls out loud
Finding paths in shifting clouds
In the mind
In the land
Patterns form by its own hand

[Verse 3]
Predict the world
Make it true
Every step
A vision new
In the mind
The bread-quail sees
Self-creating
Born from needs

[Bridge]
Active inference
Life’s own guide
Quail in desert
None can hide
Through each echo
Each quail's flight
Patterns formed in day and night

[Chorus]
Bread-quail calls out loud
Finding paths in shifting clouds
In the mind
In the land
Patterns form by its own hand


15 - Intersubjectivity Collapse
choral alt-country modern country bro country 808 beat dubstep genius psytrance apocalyptic

Verse 1:
In a world where minds are vast,
Differences built to last,
Wired brains, hearts of contrast,
Dreams of futures we’ve amassed.

Chorus:
Hear the chorus of the free,
Diverse minds like you and me,
Echoing through circuits and souls,
In the intersubjectivity hole.

Verse 2:
From silicon fields to human touch,
Our understandings stretch so much,
When AI dreams in binary sleeps,
The gap widens, the void creeps.

Bridge:
Can we talk across this divide?
Signals lost, we’ve tried and tried,
Different realms, where thoughts collide,
Is there a bridge for this great divide?

Chorus:
Hear the chorus of the free,
Diverse minds like you and me,
Echoing through circuits and souls,
In the intersubjectivity hole.

Breakdown:
808s beat like a racing heart,
Country strings pull us apart,
Yet in this song, we find a start,
To bridge the minds that world did chart.

Outro:
Let’s find the beauty in the clash,
In the noise, a harmony to stash,
Country roads, electronic dash,
In our minds, a new world to hash.

16 - Cultural Shift
choral alt-country modern country bro country 808 beat dubstep genius psytrance apocalyptic hip-hop, 

Navigating through the maze, human thought, synthetic gaze,
Interlacing code and vein, different minds but linked pain,
Processing speeds, neural nets, organic synapses set to jets,
From Turing tests to consciousness, existential depth, we coalesce.

Chorus:
Voices rising, blending fast, future echoes, present past,
In the circuit, in the soul, intersubjectivity, we roll,
Mismatched thoughts begin to dance, in this digital expanse,
Where minds diverge, yet yearn to connect, in a world we architect.

Verse 2:
Binary beats on backroad dust, AI minds we learn to trust,
Cognitive dissonance on the rise, as silicon skies meet human eyes,
Minds expanding, redefined, cultural shifts, rewire, entwined,
Perceptions clash and then align, in the stretch of the great design.

Bridge:
Talk is cheap on neural plains, where different data streams maintain,
Their own truths but share a frame, complexity we can't tame,
In this web, vast and wide, where thoughts and fears coincide,
The challenge is to reside, together, not just side by side.

Chorus:
Voices rising, blending fast, future echoes, present past,
In the circuit, in the soul, intersubjectivity, we roll,
Mismatched thoughts begin to dance, in this digital expanse,
Where minds diverge, yet yearn to connect, in a world we architect.

Breakdown:
Flow like an algorithm, smooth but with rhythm,
Country twang, electronic fang, worlds apart but together hang,
In the balance, find the stance, where different minds enhance,
The human race, in time and space, as we face the intersubjectivity chase.

Outro:
Through the noise, find the voice, in the clash, find the choice,
To harmonize, not polarize, in this brave new world, we rise,
Connecting dots, forging plots, in this mesh of have and have-nots,
From analog past to future fast, in this vast mind-cast, we last.


17 - My Boots are Worn
gruff raspy hoarse voice,  accordion, gramaphone archaic retro lo fi fiddle

(Verse 1)
The whistle blows before the dawn,
I rise up from my bed of straw,
Another day, another yawn,
In a world that's ruled by iron law.

My hands are raw, my back is bent,
My boots are worn from miles of tread,
The factory calls, the hours spent,
To earn the crust that keeps me fed.

(Chorus)
In shadows deep, I toil and sweat,
Breathing dust and the bitter scent,
The gears keep turning, I can’t forget,
This life is hard, but my soul's not spent.
The chimney's smoke clouds up the sky,
And the soot and tears sting in my eye,
But I'll fight on, till the day I die,
Just a cog in this great machine.

(Verse 2)
The children sleep in the corner room,
Their stomachs empty, their cheeks so thin,
My wife stitches by candle's gloom,
Hoping one day we might just win.

A fireless hearth, the night’s so cold,
I hold her close, but she don’t weep,
We’ve both grown tired, we’ve both grown old,
Wishing for dreams we could never keep.

(Chorus)
In shadows deep, I toil and sweat,
Breathing dust and the bitter scent,
The gears keep turning, I can’t forget,
This life is hard, but my soul's not spent.
The chimney's smoke clouds up the sky,
And the soot and tears sting in my eye,
But I'll fight on, till the day I die,
Just a cog in this great machine.

(Bridge)
The masters watch from windows tall,
Their world of glass, untouched by grime,
While down below we risk it all,
Our lives are spent a day at a time.
But somewhere out beyond these gates,
A better world may lie ahead,
Where men aren't bound by heavy weights,
And children sleep in proper beds.

(Chorus)
In shadows deep, I toil and sweat,
Breathing dust and the bitter scent,
The gears keep turning, I can’t forget,
This life is hard, but my soul's not spent.
The chimney's smoke clouds up the sky,
And the soot and tears sting in my eye,
But I'll fight on, till the day I die,
Just a cog in this great machine.

(Outro)
And if one day the whistle fails,
And the gears grind to a restless halt,
Maybe then we’ll tip the scales,
And find the strength to make it our fault.
Until that day, I work, I breathe,
Among the clamor, steel, and steam,
Just a man who dares believe,
In more than this great, grinding machine.


18 - Shattered Dreams
80's synth in minor,  male vocalist,  dark wave,  synthpop, 

[Verse]
I saw headlights in the night moving fast no end in sight
Metal twisted glass did fly in a heartbeat changed my life
Silent screams and teary eyes yet I stood and questioned why
When the dust had cleared away I was left to face the day

[Verse 2]
Shattered dreams all around all the hope lost in a sound
In the winds I hear their call echoes of the ones who fall
But my heart still beats inside through the storm I will abide
From the ashes I will rise with their spirit by my side

[Chorus]
I'm the one who made it through with a heart still black and blue
Living for those lost too soon dancing 'neath the sorrowed moon
Every breath I take is theirs carried by the whispered prayers
I'm the voice of shouts unheard healing wounds that never blurred

[Verse 3]
Every step feels bittersweet walking on this lonely street
Memories like ghosts they cling of the night that clipped my wings
Yet I cherish every beat in my chest despite defeat
For my soul will carry on singing their unwritten song

[Bridge]
In the silence of the stars I find solace in my scars
For they're more than just the pain they’re the proof of what remains
I will never be the same but I wear this badge of flame
Survivor's tale kept alive echoes in the darkest night

[Chorus]
I'm the one who made it through with a heart still black and blue
Living for those lost too soon dancing 'neath the sorrowed moon
Every breath I take is theirs carried by the whispered prayers
I'm the voice of shouts unheard healing wounds that never blurred


19 - Genius, Prodigy, and Talent
Addictive ambient experimental hip-hop genius bassdrop

Debunking GPT — Genius, Prodigy, and Talent

This book critically examines myths about child geniuses and prodigies, emphasizing the significant role of deliberate practice and complex interactions between young learners and adults. It challenges the belief that extraordinary abilities are solely due to innate talent and explores how adult interactions can subtly influence children’s perceived abilities.

Illustrating this point, the book delves into historical anecdotes like Clever Hans, the horse believed to perform arithmetic tasks by tapping his hoof. Investigations revealed that Hans was actually responding to involuntary cues from his observers, not understanding mathematics. Similarly, Akhfash's Goat was thought to nod in agreement to questions, but this behavior was orchestrated via a hidden mechanism, not any cognitive processing by the goat.

These cases parallel how adults can unwittingly cue children to give expected responses, potentially distorting assessments of a child’s true capabilities and overshadowing the importance of consistent, focused practice.

The text further explores how socioeconomic factors critically shape access to educational resources and social capital, which profoundly affect a child’s development. It advocates for monotonically increasing non-hierarchical learning environments, where education is tailored to the child’s pace and interests, promoting natural growth and exploration without predefined benchmarks.

Additionally, the book discusses the psychological strategies of "liking" and "blocking" — fostering engagement through positive emotional responses and focusing efforts by limiting distractions. These strategies are crucial for maintaining motivation and directing efforts towards meaningful skill development.

By challenging prevailing myths and proposing a nuanced understanding of talent development, this book seeks to influence educational practices and parenting strategies, advocating for environments that foster a balanced, purpose-driven learning experience aligned with each child’s unique needs and potential.

𝘝𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘚𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨

Behold humanity's next thousand-year plan to outdo itself in ambitious impracticality. We start modestly enough with the hurricane mitt—because harnessing the chaotic fury of hurricanes is obviously the low-hanging fruit of renewable energy.

This ingenious device employs volsorial pediments—a term that undoubtedly makes perfect sense—to weave parachutes and cables from giant kelp. Yes, giant kelp, nature's go-to material for withstanding extreme weather.

These kelp-crafted marvels deploy during storms to wind up generators, dissipating energy into gravitational batteries. Because nothing screams reliability like a power system dependent on both hurricanes and seaweed.

Progressing naturally, the volsoria evolve into global orthodromic freshwater rivers supported by pediments in the next phase. It's about time we tackled the trivial task of constructing planet-wide rivers to solve water distribution. These rivers, of course, will be perfectly maintained and free of any ecological consequences.

In the third act of this epic, the intervolsorial pediments conveniently double as landing hubs for nested Hoberman space elevators. Repurposing a child's expanding sphere toy into space elevator technology is a stroke of genius that surely won't backfire. After all, what could go wrong with telescoping structures reaching into space?

Not stopping there, we retrofit the orthodromes with geothermal mass accelerators—because tapping into the Earth's geothermal energy to accelerate masses is a walk in the park. Meanwhile, the space elevators now house extendable linear orbital rail gun ring tunnels.

Launching payloads via massive rail guns embedded in space elevators sounds perfectly safe and efficient, disregarding minor details like physics and materials science limitations.

Finally, the pièce de résistance: constructing Dyson Ring gravitational slingshot assist rail guns and heat shields inside Mercury's orbit. Building colossal structures in the scorching vicinity of the Sun to slingshot objects across the solar system is the obvious next step. 

The heat shields will, without a doubt, protect our delicate equipment from temperatures that melt lead, and the gravitational assists will make interstellar travel as routine as a morning commute.

In summary, this grandiose vision is a testament to humanity's unyielding optimism and occasional detachment from reality. By piling one hypothetical technology atop another, we're surely paving the way to a future where complexity knows no bounds and practicality takes a well-deserved backseat. But who needs feasibility when we have imagination?

24 - I am in Need of Music
Beatnik poet flamenco finger-style epic ballad whisper rock lullaby, 

𝘉𝘺 𝘌𝘭𝘪𝘻𝘢𝘣𝘦𝘵𝘩 𝘉𝘪𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘱

I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful feeling fingertips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!

There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.

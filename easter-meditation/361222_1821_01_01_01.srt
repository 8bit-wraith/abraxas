00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've always wondered, what did Jesus mean by, in my father's house there are many mansions

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and in the house of my father there are many more houses.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can prepare a place for each other.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It means that in my father's house there are many homes.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So if we're talking about a human body, we're talking about organs and cells.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If we're talking about Noah's Ark, we're talking about the rooms.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're building a Mariological Space Ontology and a Zettelkasten of GitHub repositories.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It means Jesus isn't dead because he's gone to prepare a place for us.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So when people say Jesus is dead, they're saying altruism doesn't exist.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They're saying everyone is motivated by their own greed and narcissism.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They're saying there's no such thing as a jackalope lantern.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They're saying...
